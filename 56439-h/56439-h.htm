<p class="drop-cap">THE <i>Sachsen</i> was a freighter of the
Baltic-American line, plying between
New York and Hamburg; she
was tied to her pier in the North River,
receiving cargo, that afternoon, when
fire was discovered among the bales of
cotton that were being loaded into her
forward hold; and according to the
foreman of her forward-hold gang of
freight-handlers, the fire started in a
longshoreman&#8217;s clay pipe, smoked,
against orders, while the man was at his
work below decks receiving the bales.
According to the officials of the Baltic-American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
line, the fire was &#8220;a pure case
of spontaneous combustion;&#8221; and the
newspapers of the day reported it as
such. But when New York&#8217;s new fire-boat,
the <i>Hudson</i>, in answer to the
alarm from the pier, came whistling up
the river from her berth near the
Battery and turned in under the starboard
quarter of the big <i>Sachsen</i>, Captain
Keighley of the <i>Hudson</i> looked up
to see a longshoreman scowling down at
him over the steamship&#8217;s bulwarks; and
the presence of that particular longshoreman
was at the moment as ominous
of trouble for old Keighley as it
subsequently became significant to him
in considering the origin of the fire.</p>

<p>For the man was an ex-fireman, of
the name of Doherty, whom Captain
Keighley had helped to dismiss from
the service of the fire-department one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
week before. The reasons for his dismissal
need not concern us here. The
important point is that he had been a
&#8220;Jigger-jumper,&#8221; as the members of a
certain &#8220;benevolent association&#8221; of the
firemen had been nicknamed; and Captain
Keighley&#8217;s crew was full of
&#8220;Jiggers&#8221; who were eager to avenge
their fellow &#8220;Jigger&#8221; for the loss of his
uniform.</p>

<p>Captain Keighley, when he looked up
to see Doherty above him, was standing
on the cement roof of the <i>Hudson&#8217;s</i>
wheelhouse, beside a monitor nozzle that
could drive a hole through a brick wall
with a stream as stiff as a steel bar; and
the fact that he stood in this place of
command by virtue of his own cunning,
in spite of intrigue in the fire-department
and treachery in his own crew, did
not show in the look that he lifted to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
enemy overhead. At most he showed
only a cool reliance on the streams of
the <i>Hudson</i> to cope with any mischief
that might be in hand; for the <i>Hudson</i>
had a battery of four sets of duplex
pumps that could force out of her pipes
as much water in a minute as twenty
shore-engines in a row; and Keighley
was eager for a big fire to test her
powers on.</p>

<p>The pilot in the wheelhouse brought
her sweeping into the narrow slip beside
the <i>Sachsen</i>, riding the ridges of
her own swell&mdash;her keel all but naked
amidships&mdash;and reversed with a suddenness
that shook her to the stack.
From the deck of the <i>Sachsen</i> men were
bawling down: &#8220;Cotton in the forrud
hold! Cotton afire! Cotton afire!&#8221;
Captain Keighley struck at the whistle
rope and blew for tugboats. &#8220;Moore,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
he called to his lieutenant, &#8220;get a
lighter alongside here and wet down
the cotton I hoist out. Couple up two
lines. Get the cotton spray.&#8221;</p>

<p>In handling such cotton fires, it is the
way of the expert to extinguish the
worst of the flames in the hold and then
to hook out the smoldering bales, hoist
them to the open air, lower them to the
deck of a lighter and play the hose on
them there until they are drenched. To
that end, Keighley divided his crew into
two squads, one of which he ordered to
remain on the <i>Hudson</i>, with Lieutenant
Moore, to receive the smoking bales as
they came from the <i>Sachsen</i>, and the
other he ordered to ascend the high side
of the <i>Sachsen</i>, on their scaling ladders
with two lines of hose, to attack the
flames in the freighter&#8217;s hold. But in
picking the men for these separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
squads, Keighley was careful to gather
into one of them all the members of his
crew whom he knew to be &#8220;Jiggers,&#8221;
and this squad he himself led up the
scaling ladders to the deck of the <i>Sachsen</i>;
the other men, who were not &#8220;Jiggers,&#8221;
he left on the <i>Hudson</i> in charge
of Lieutenant Moore, who was the
&#8220;financial secretary&#8221; of the association
and the leader of the conspiracy against
Keighley in the company. By so doing,
Keighley aimed, of course, to keep all
the disaffected men under his own
eye and to leave Moore behind with the
loyal men where he could do no harm.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Moore understood these
tactics and smiled to himself sourly.
There was another man who smiled&mdash;but
with a more triumphant expression
of malice; and that was the ex-fireman
Doherty, who had been scowling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
at Captain Keighley over the rail. And
Keighley had not been more than ten
minutes in the hold of the <i>Sachsen</i>
when another blaze&mdash;independently,
unexpectedly, and from no known cause
whatever&mdash;burst out among the bales
of cotton that were waiting to be
loaded, in the pierhouse, whither
Doherty had retreated.</p>

<p>The pierhouse was a wooden structure&mdash;though
it was covered on the
outside with a corrugated sheet-iron.
Its beams were sifted over with the fine
dust of innumerable cargoes; and its
whole length was unprotected by a
single hose hydrant or fire extinguisher.
The result was a spread of flames so
sudden that before the freight handlers
had ceased running and shouting for
buckets, the fire had leaped to the timbers
of the shed and begun to sing there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
busily; and Doherty, still smiling to
himself, only escaped from the burning
end of the wharf by jumping into the
slip.</p>

<p>At first, Lieutenant Moore did not see
his opportunity; he remained stubbornly
aboard the <i>Hudson</i> waiting for
further orders. But when the shouts
on the burning pier drew him to the
deck of the <i>Sachsen</i>, he found that Captain
Keighley and his men were still
deep in the <i>Sachsen&#8217;s</i> hold with the
steamship&#8217;s crew; and then he understood,
foresaw, and made ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn fine management,&#8221; he grumbled,
&#8220;to go down there and leave a
blaze like this behind him! Get another
line up here!&#8221;</p>

<p>The men obeyed with alacrity, but by
the time they got water through their
hose, they had only a squirt-gun stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
to use against the fire that was developing
inside the pierhouse&#8217;s corrugated
sheet-iron shell. They could not see the
extent of that fire; and Lieutenant
Moore, grumbling and complaining, did
not appreciate the fact that in the flames
which began to strike out from the windows
of the pierhouse through the
smoke, there was more than the disgrace
of Captain Keighley for blundering in
his conduct of the attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell of a captain!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;If
it wasn&#8217;t for the shore companies now,
this end of the water-front&#8217;d get <i>good</i>
and singed!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sparks began to blow over on
the <i>Sachsen</i> from the pier, and Moore
ran back to order up another line of
hose from the <i>Hudson</i>. He called to
the men on the fire-boat to train a
stream from the monitor nozzle, over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the deck of the <i>Sachsen</i>, to the roof of
the pier building; and he was promptly
obeyed; but the stream was so strong
that when it was raised to clear the bulwarks
of the <i>Sachsen</i> it shot over the
pier, and there was nothing to be done
but to train it still higher, to let the
water drop on the buildings, sprinkling
them instead of tearing them to
pieces. Fire caught the awnings of the
<i>Sachsen</i>; the firemen drenched them.
A puff of blaze reached her house-work;
they fought it off. Moore ordered here,
cursed and complained there, and ran
around futilely; and, at last, realizing
with what a fire he was at such close
quarters, he cried out frantically to cast
off the hawsers and tow the <i>Sachsen</i> to
midstream.</p>

<p>There was no one left to cast off.
The firemen had to get their axes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the <i>Hudson</i> and chop through the wire
ropes. The steel strands resisted long
enough to complete the disaster, and
when the last thread parted under the
axeblades, the current still held the
<i>Sachsen</i> hard against the wharf.</p>

<p>A stewardess ran out from the cabins,
screaming that the after house-work
was afire.</p>

<p>The whole catastrophe had developed
so quickly that the thought uppermost
in Lieutenant Moore&#8217;s mind was still his
first one of Captain Keighley&#8217;s disgrace;
and when he lost his head and began
to shout at the men&mdash;like an officer
in the panic of a retreat&mdash;it was abuse
of Captain Keighley that he shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the hell did he want to go
down in the hold for, with a fire like this
up here? He&#8217;s a hell of a captain, <i>he</i>
is! He&#8217;s a hell of a captain!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>One of the pipemen, (whose name was
Farley), without turning his head,
growled under his helmet, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t
yuh haul her out o&#8217; here long ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t she come out now?&#8221;
Moore cried. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t.
Because she <i>won&#8217;t</i>! That&#8217;s why! Because
she <i>can&#8217;t</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>The tugs, whistling and panting
around her, got their lines on the after
bitts and pulled and shouldered and
struggled noisily. But by the time they
got her under way, the crew of the
<i>Sachsen</i>, alarmed by the screams of the
stewardess, were already diving overboard,
and Lieutenant Moore&#8217;s men
were retiring from a blaze that seemed
to spit back their streams on them in
spurts of steam.</p>

<p>Moore ordered Farley to go below
decks and warn Captain Keighley and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the squad in the hold. Farley glanced
at his fellows; they were all partisans
of the captain; they had been chafing
under Moore&#8217;s attacks on him, and they
were contemptuous of the lieutenant for
the way in which he had mishandled the
pierhouse blaze. Moreover, there were
only four of them to two lines of hose;
and the one unnecessary man there, as
they saw the situation, was Moore. Let
him go himself.</p>

<p>The lieutenant repeated his orders.
Farley sulkily remained where he was.
And&mdash;what with &#8220;Jiggers&#8221; and &#8220;Anti-Jiggers,&#8221;
the influence of the fire commissioner
who was a &#8220;Jigger&#8221; and the
influence of the chief who was not, the
party of Captain Keighley and the followers
of Lieutenant Moore&mdash;discipline
on the <i>Hudson</i> had come to such a pass
that Moore had no redress against a subordinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
who refused to obey his orders.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he threatened. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see
to <i>you</i>, too!&#8221; and turned to run for the
hatch.</p>

<p>The men grinned. The <i>Hudson</i>, trying
to bring its monitor to bear on the
burning woodwork of the <i>Sachsen</i>, shot
a terrific stream, roaring and threshing,
close to their heads. Farley said:
&#8220;That darn fool&#8217;ll be sweepin&#8217; us off
here in a minute. We&#8217;d better get inside
out o&#8217; this an&#8217; help in <i>there</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>They retreated aft for shelter, dragging
their hose; and by doing so they
left the forward deck to the flames that
were blown over the <i>Sachsen</i> by a steady
breeze.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MEANWHILE, Lieutenant Moore
had found Captain Keighley
and the &#8220;Jiggers,&#8221; with their two lines,
working busily in the choke of cotton
smoke in the deep hold, playing one pipe
on the heart of the fire and with the
other sprinkling the bales around it.
And Captain Keighley, with his helmet
awry on his head and a smile of contempt
slanting his mouth, feeling the
<i>Hudson&#8217;s</i> eight pumps behind him, was
playing a game with that fire, happily.
The screeches of the stewardess and the
flight of the ship&#8217;s crew had not alarmed
him. He was used to the sight of blind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
fright; he saw the flames before him
confined and beaten back; and he knew
that for any fire that might develop behind
him, the <i>Hudson</i> was a park of
cannon drawn up in reserve.</p>

<p>It did not occur to him that the <i>Hudson</i>,
drawn up under the high side of the
<i>Sachsen</i>, was a park of cannon in a hole
in the ground.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Moore, explaining in the
manner of a man with a grievance, took
a valuable minute to make the situation
plain. He made it plainer than he
knew. Keighley narrowed his old eyes
and nodded. &#8220;Back out, boys!&#8221; he
called. &#8220;Leave yer lines. We&#8217;ll pick
&#8217;em up from the deck.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men dropped their hose and
climbed up the ladders; and as soon as
they had passed the orlop deck it was
evident to them that they were in a trap.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Flames were blowing across the hatch
above them, as if the very air had suddenly
become inflammable and taken
fire from the fierce heat of the July sun.
Captain Keighley led up the ladders
until he was almost at the top&mdash;and
then dropped down again. There was
no escape by that way.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to go aft between decks,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>An officer of the <i>Sachsen</i>, who had remained
with the firemen fighting the
fire, replied in broken English that this
forward hold was shut off from the rest
of the boat by two bulkheads and a
cross-bunker.</p>

<p>Captain Keighley said, &#8220;Here! You
know yer own boat. Take us out o&#8217;
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The German shook his big, blond
head, thought a moment, shook it again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and then made a pass with his hand and
nodded.</p>

<p>He dropped down the ladder, and
they followed him, choking, back to the
deep hold. He groped his way aft in
the smoke to the partition of steel plates
that makes the after wall of the cargo
room, and there he stopped. They
heard him beating on the plates with the
dull blows of a fat fist. One of the firemen
passed him a belt hatchet. He
rang it on the bulkhead.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>Captain Keighley seized it and
rapped like a miner signalling for aid.</p>

<p>The German said resignedly, &#8220;T&#8217;ey
haf gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>But they had not gone. There was
an answering tap from the other side
of the metal; a bolt squeaked and
grated; and then the bulkhead door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
swung back on the empty coal bunker
and the faint glow of a furnace in the
stoke hole.</p>

<p>Through this narrow opening the firemen
crawled into an atmosphere that
was cool by comparison with the one
they had been breathing in the burning
cargo room; and they drew long breaths
of relief there, looking around the well
of steel at the bottom of which they
stood. The German officer took a little
tin lamp&mdash;the shape of a miniature
watering pot with a flame in the spout&mdash;and
held it to give light to the two
stokers, who were screwing the bolts of
the door in place again; and one of the
stokers looked back over his shoulder,
surprised at this condescension. The
officer said nothing until both doors
were fast. Then he growled at the
stokers gutturally&mdash;and on the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
they dropped their tools and ran, with
the whole party at their heels, between
hot boilers, through dark furnace
rooms, between more boilers, through
the doors of other bulkheads, and finally
into the grated galleries of the engine
room, where they found two engineers
still standing before their levers, waiting
for further orders from the bridge.</p>

<p>Captain Keighley, thus far, had
moved with a certain swift calmness,
speaking in a low voice, and using his
eyes, as he used his hands, deliberately,
without any darting glances or quick
turns. But when he looked up the
railed ladders that rose from tier to tier
of machinery in the engine room, he
heard a sound above him that he had not
expected; and he started up those
ladders at the double quick.</p>

<p>The crackle of the fire grew louder as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
he climbed. He heard cries and shouting
in the cabins. He smelt scorch
again. A puff of heat swirled down on
him in a fierce blast. And when he
reached the sliding door that gave on
the deck, the passageway was filled with
smoke.</p>

<p>Here the four firemen who had refused
to obey Lieutenant Moore and
who were caught in the burning house-work,
came running down on their captain.
&#8220;It&#8217;s no go&mdash;that way&mdash;Cap&#8217;n,&#8221;
Farley cried.</p>

<p>Keighley grasped the greasy railing
of the ladder and slid down on the
&#8220;Jiggers&#8221; who had been following him
up. &#8220;Get further aft!&#8221; he ordered.</p>

<p>They dropped into the engine room as
lightly as they would have dropped
down the sliding poles of their
&#8220;house,&#8221; and they called to the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
officer to show them another stairway
further aft. That officer did not
need to be told what they had found
above them. He jumped down among
the dynamos, stumbled past the ice
engine, dived through the open door of
the shaft tunnel, and swinging himself
to the ladder that went up the inside of
a ventilator shaft, he led them up that
narrow flue hand over hand.</p>

<p>They were not half way up it before
they met what they had met above
the engine room&mdash;a suffocating heat and
smother. The firemen heard the German
growling and coughing above them,
as big and clumsy as a bear that is being
smoked out of a hollow tree. Captain
Keighley caught up to him and shouted
to him go on. He answered nothing
that was intelligible, and tried to back
down. Keighley ordered him to hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
fast, and went up over him like a cat.</p>

<p>The others waited, head to heels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t make it,&#8221; they heard the captain
call at last. &#8220;Back down, men!
Back down!&#8221;</p>

<p>They went down without a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;We got to wait here till they get that
blaze out,&#8221; he said curtly. &#8220;She&#8217;s afire
up there from end to end. I&#8217;ve shut
the ventilator cover to keep out the
smoke. We&#8217;ll be better down below
here till they get some water on her.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were in the shaft tunnel&mdash;a
corridor of steel plates, seven feet high,
five feet wide, and more than thirty feet
long. From end to end of it, the big
shaft that spins the starboard propeller
lay shining like a steel python,
stretched and bound in its bearings. At
one end was the wall through which the
shaft passed to the after peak and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
screw; at the other was the entrance
from the engine room, already blue with
smoke; above them was the throat of the
closed ventilator. They were in a metal
vault, far below the surface of the river,
with every avenue of escape cut off by
the fire above them.</p>

<p>Captain Keighley leaned back against
the shaft and took off his helmet.</p>

<p>The men stood waiting. They had
depended on him to show them the way
out of the danger into which he had led
them. One of the &#8220;Jiggers&#8221;&mdash;it was
&#8220;Shine&#8221; Conlin&mdash;demanded, &#8220;How are
we goin&#8217; to get up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Keighley rounded on him,
&#8220;I&#8217;m not keepin&#8217; yuh, am I? Get up
any way yuh like!&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">III</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE words were given like a challenge&mdash;a
challenge to one of those
trials of authority in which the trained
leader, turning on his rebellious followers,
seems to use the hand of chance
and circumstance to whip them into
line&mdash;a challenge that struck the men
before him with a little start of surprise
that passed over the group like a
shudder.</p>

<p>They stared at him. Some of them
were pale, with lips parted. One of the
captain&#8217;s own faction had an odd expression
of hurt amazement and reproach.
Another was frowning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; said angrily, &#8220;<i>You</i> brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
us down here. Why the hell don&#8217;t yuh
take us up?&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain smiled. He was clean-shaven,
lean-cheeked, thin-lipped; and
his smile was not sweet&mdash;for he knew
that he had been beaten by the fire, and
he knew that he could have been so
beaten only because of the treachery of
his lieutenant and the &#8220;Jiggers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Moore,&#8221; he said, &#8220;take yer gang
back to the <i>Hudson</i>. It&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be
cooler out there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lieutenant blinked at him. It
was the first time that Keighley had
openly shown his quiet understanding
of the intrigues among the crew, and the
change in his manner was a sufficient
menace without the sarcastic implication
of his words. What that implication
was, Moore was trying not to let
himself consider. Fires had been to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
him what battles are to the general who
has political ambitions. That the issue
of any one of them might endanger his
career had been possible; that it might
end his life had never seriously occurred
to him. And the Adam&#8217;s apple in his
throat worked like a feed-pump gone
dry as he swallowed and swallowed that
fear.</p>

<p>The men looked at him; and it was
evident that he was in no condition to
think for them. They looked at the
captain; and Keighley&#8217;s hard eyes were
glittering hostilely as they shifted down
the line from face to face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw yer frien&#8217; Doherty on deck,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I guess yer benev&#8217;lent association
o&#8217; Jigger-jumpers had something
to do with this bus&#8217;ness, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>They did not answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I hope it&#8217;s good fer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
it. It&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be a heavy call on the
treasurer&mdash;five o&#8217; yuh&mdash;in a bunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; turned with an oath and ran
out to the engine room. The others
broke and followed him. Keighley,
alone with his lieutenant, regarded him
grimly.</p>

<p>The old captain had been a fireman
since the days when the Sunday fights
between the volunteer hose companies
in Philadelphia had been the &#8220;only
mode of public worship on the Sabbath&#8221;
there. When those fights had
culminated in riot, bloodshed, and the
burning of churches, he had come to
New York, and run with the &#8220;goose-necks&#8221;
and defied the &#8220;leather-heads&#8221;
until the paid brigade was formed and
he took service with it. He had been
living among men and politicians ever
since; and to the natural cunning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
north of Ireland &#8220;sharp-nose&#8221; he had
added a cynical experience that filled
him to the full with the sort of wisdom
that comes of such a life. Lieutenant
Moore had been so simple to him that
the &#8220;boy&#8217;s&#8221; attempts to supplant him,
with the aid of the Fire Commissioner
and the &#8220;Jiggers,&#8221; had amused him like
a game. He looked at Moore, now, with
a bitter contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;You youngsters in the department,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;yuh&#8217;re great politicians. But
what yuh don&#8217;t know about a fire&#8217;s
enough to keep yuh from tryin&#8217; to do
tricks with one&mdash;er it ought to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moore shook his head, dazedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yuh&#8217;re goin&#8217; to get yer fingers burnt
now. An&#8217; it serves yuh damn well
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moore turned away in silence and
stumbled out to the engine room. Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Keighley, having watched him go,
proceeded to examine the shaft tunnel
at his leisure. He found nothing but a
ball of cotton waste, which he stuffed
into his pocket. Then he leaned back
calmly and waited for his crew to return.</p>

<p>They were in the engine room, standing
in the thickening smoke, waiting for
nothing, with the quietness of disgusted
despair. Sparks were beginning to
fall down through the gratings. Little
splashes of hot water sprinkled on them
from above. They looked up at the reflection
of the flames that were purring
overhead, speaking in low voices to one
another; and every now and then a man
who had gone forward toward the stoke
holes, or been down on his face crawling
below the machinery, came back to them
from a vain attempt to find a safer spot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and made the gesture of failure. A
young German stoker was biting his
lips and whining like a frightened dog.</p>

<p>The last slow pulse of the engines
stopped; the electric lights died out, and
the glare of the fire reddened the shining
metal of columns, cylinders and
piston rods. No one moved. They
watched, as if fascinated, the approach
of a burning horror that seemed to be
fighting its way down to them through
the bars of the gratings, snarling.</p>

<p>At last an engineer joined them with
a lamp from the stoke hole, and, after
consulting with the German officer, he
led them all back to the dark shaft tunnel.
He passed them through, and slid
over the steel door until there was only
a narrow aperture left unclosed. He
squeezed himself through that slit, and
then with hammer and cold-chisel drove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the door home until the opening was
merely a crack wide enough to admit the
finger ends. The men plugged this
crack with their coats. He put his lamp
on top of a shaft-bearing.</p>

<p>It showed Captain Keighley still
standing there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that,&#8221; he said to one of the
firemen who had begun to strip to the
skin. &#8220;Yuh&#8217;ll want all yuh can get between
yuh an&#8217; the metal, as soon&#8217;s that
after cargo gets goin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man grumbled, &#8220;We&#8217;ll be sittin&#8217;
on top of a redhot stove in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Keighley replied, &#8220;Yuh can
go outside an&#8217; sit <i>in</i> one, if yuh want
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Moore took a quivering
breath through dry nostrils and shut his
teeth on the trembling of his jaws. He
could hear a low murmur from the fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
that was roaring above decks. The
little lamp flared dully on the bearings.
Beyond that, there was nothing but
darkness and silence and the heat that
choked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Captain Keighley challenged
them.</p>

<p>No one replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess yuh got what yuh been
workin&#8217; fer, ain&#8217;t yuh? Yuh got me
into trouble. Yuh been tryin&#8217; hard
enough to push me into a hole ever since
I broke Doherty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, sir,&#8221; a fireman named
Cripps spoke up. &#8220;We&#8217;re all in this
together. There&#8217;s no use jawin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; another added plaintively.</p>

<p>Captain Keighley nodded. &#8220;If
yuh&#8217;d been all together from the first,
we wouldn&#8217;t be here, d&#8217; yuh see?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>Several of the men answered, &#8220;Twasn&#8217;t
our fault.&#8221; They looked at the
lieutenant, who had dropped his head
and was gazing, empty-eyed, at his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; Keighley asked suavely.
&#8220;Well, it wasn&#8217;t mine, was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>No one spoke again until Cripps asked
weakly, &#8220;Can yuh get us out, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Yes. If yuh live
long enough, an&#8217; <i>I</i> do, I&#8217;ll get y&#8217; <i>all</i> out....
I&#8217;ll get out ev&#8217;ry man o&#8217; yuh
that&#8217;s breathin&#8217;, any way.... We
got to wait here till that fire burns
down; that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young stoker had begun to sob.
Lieutenant Moore opened his parched
lips to speak, but his tongue, swollen
and dry, like a piece of flannel in his
mouth, was too thick to turn a word.
The sound of flames rose suddenly to a
muffled grumble.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>Captain Keighley said, &#8220;Here&#8217;s some
cotton waste I hunted up. Pull a wad
off to plug yer noses, an&#8217; tie somethin&#8217;
over yer mouths. We&#8217;ll be breathin&#8217;
scorch before we&#8217;re through.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tore off a ball of waste and passed
the roll to Moore. It travelled down
the line from hand to hand&mdash;as if for a
sign of union and peace among them&mdash;like
a &#8220;pax.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;get away from
the sides o&#8217; that cargo room, an&#8217; lay
yerselves out &#8217;s flat &#8217;s yuh can.&#8221;</p>

<p>The majority of the men obeyed him
meekly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Stay there
now. It&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be so hot in here that
some o&#8217; yuh&#8217;ll be goin&#8217; off yer heads.
Yuh don&#8217;t want to do that. Yuh want
to hang on, see? Keep still an&#8217; hang
on. An&#8217; if yuh feel yerself goin&#8217; loose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
get a hold o&#8217; the floor, anyway, an&#8217; don&#8217;t
let go.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took up the engineer&#8217;s hammer,
stepped down to the door, and put his
back against it. &#8220;I&#8217;ll brain any man
that tries to open this door before I give
the word,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>They were a mixed lot&mdash;Keighley&#8217;s
crew&mdash;picked from all the battalions in
the city to serve on the new <i>Hudson</i>.
There was &#8220;Shine&#8221; Conlin, a blue-jowled
Bowery type, who had been
newsboy, boot-black, (whence the
&#8220;Shine&#8221;) wharf-rat, deck-hand, plug-ugly
and leader of his gang; he had
come into the department from the
ranks of the &#8220;Con Scully Association&#8221;
to earn a regular salary for the support
of &#8220;th&#8217; ol&#8217; crow,&#8221; his mother; and he
was the most aggressive &#8220;Jigger&#8221; in the
company. Even now, he did not obey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Keighley&#8217;s orders. Instead of lying
down, he sat up against a shaft bearing;
and instead of covering his mouth, he
filled it with &#8220;fine-cut&#8221; from a package
in his hip pocket and tried to chew it
nonchalantly. His mouth was so dry
that he felt as if he were trying to chew
excelsior; it was tasteless. He turned
it over and over in his jaw, until it was
pulverized, like chaff. Then he blew it
out, with an oath.</p>

<p>At his feet lay a huge truck driver
named Nicholas Sturton and nicknamed
&#8220;The Tur&#8217;ble Turk.&#8221; He was of the
captain&#8217;s faction, because he was by
nature loyal to appointed authority
and solemnly conscientious in the
fulfilment of all his duties. He had tied
the red rags of a bandana handkerchief
over his mouth and plugged his hairy
nostrils with the cotton waste; and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
eyes stared and his great chest heaved
in his efforts to breathe through his gag.
When he looked at Keighley, it was with
the mute and patient appeal of a big
boy, in pain, looking at the doctor who
is watching over his suffering.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Moore, like &#8220;Shine,&#8221; was
sitting, but with his head in his hands,
the cotton waste forgotten in them, his
mouth fallen open. He had had a good
education in the public schools; he was
cursed with the imagination of the
trained mind; and he suffered all the
horrors of death every time he gasped.
He was ready to weep with pity for
himself, but his tears dried up before
they reached his scorched eyelids. He
was the pride of his parents, and the
dominant note of his self pity was a
sympathy for them in their disappointment
in his end. &#8220;A hell of a finish,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
he was saying to himself. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a
hell of a finish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cripps, a sly youth, freckled and
sandy, had lain down carefully on his
side, in silence, with the instinct of a
trapped animal to &#8220;lie low&#8221; and wait.
He had joined the &#8220;Jiggers&#8221; because
the Fire Commissioner was of their
party and he looked for promotion to
come when the old chief, Borden,
should be deposed and his successor
named from the faction which the Commissioner
favored. He refused to consider
his present situation as more than
a temporary interruption of his plans.
He kept his mind off the thought of
death, and busied himself trying to
make his mouth &#8220;water&#8221; with the
thought of cool lager beer in foaming
schooners. He even achieved a secret
smile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>The other men lay quiet&mdash;some flat on
their backs, staring glassily at the steel
beams overhead; some panting with convulsive
chests as the heat increased;
some on their faces with their heads on
their arms, gagged and stifling; some
drawn up in strained and twisted attitudes,
as if in pain. In their swollen
eyeballs sudden lights darted and burst.
Above the noise of the blood in their
ears, they heard a sound of moaning.
A choked voice began to struggle in the
first wanderings of delirium.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady, there! Steady!&#8221; Captain
Keighley called out. He was standing
up, his arms crossed, his face drenched
with perspiration&mdash;in absolute and unquestioned
command at last.</p>

<p>He was still standing there when the
lamp burned low, flickered and went out.</p>

<p>The darkness was soon unbearable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
with heat; and Keighley put down his
hammer and began to strip himself to
his underclothes and rubber boots. He
could hear the men tearing at their
woolen underwear as they ripped it off.
Someone was singing a German ballad
in a shrill nasal whine.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was an outbreak of
oaths. &#8220;Shine&#8221; had begun to curse.
Having arrived at an insane notion that
Keighley had penned them all in there,
he was promising himself an indescribable
revenge if he ever escaped. He
kicked out at Cripps&mdash;who had torn the
bandage from his mouth to get more
imaginary beer, and was gurgling to
himself over it&mdash;and that started a confusion
of crazy voices and weak complaints.
A man crawled over Sturton
and screamed when &#8220;Turk&#8221; seized him
by the throat, struggling, with an uproar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
that set all bedlam loose. The men
began to fight, clutching at one another,
rolling about with feeble blows, writhing
like eels baked alive in an oven, like
the lost souls in old pictures of hell.
&#8220;Shine&#8221; leaped on Keighley and went
down under a blow that almost split his
forehead. The place was a pandemonium&mdash;awful&mdash;indescribable....</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the silence of
exhaustion had settled down on hoarse
breathings and low groans. And Captain
Keighley, sitting with his back to
the door&mdash;his knees drawn up, his head
resting on them, nauseated&mdash;was struggling
against a whirling lapse of consciousness.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE fire on the <i>Sachsen</i> had been
discovered when the freight-handlers
returned to work after their midday
meal. All that afternoon the boat
burned and drifted; and by nightfall
she was beached, on the Jersey mudflats,
with her paint peeled off her sides,
her funnels blackened, her upper works
a skeleton of blistered metal, lying, grey
and hot, like a smoking fire-log, and
steaming where the streams from the
tugs and fire-boats struck her.</p>

<p>The <i>Hudson</i> had followed her, with
Deputy-Chief Moran in charge, the remnants
of Keighley&#8217;s crew working desperately
to drown out the fire. They
had given up all hope of saving Keighley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
and the men who were with him, but
they did not give up the appearance or
the efforts of hope, although there had
not been a sound or a sight of life on the
<i>Sachsen</i> for eight hours, now, and she
was slowly settling with the tons of
water that were being poured into her
cargo holds.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use,&#8221; Moran said, with the
coming of darkness&mdash;and relinquished
even the pretence of the possibility of a
rescue.</p>

<p>He went to shelter himself, behind the
<i>Hudson&#8217;s</i> wheelhouse, from the radiated
heat of the smoldering hulk, his
mind busy with the affairs of the department.
He heard a noise of hammering
that seemed to come from the <i>Sachsen</i>,
and he thought it was the sound of a
pump set going by some crazy accident
of the fire. At a shout from a fireman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
on the other side of the <i>Hudson</i>, he came
out again to the bows wearily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw a light,&#8221; the man cried.
&#8220;There!&#8221;</p>

<p>The spark of a lantern was swinging
from side to side on the <i>Sachsen</i> high
up, amidships.</p>

<p>They howled, &#8220;Hi! Hi! Hullo! All
right! All right, boys! Hol&#8217; on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn the spray on the deck here,&#8221;
Moran ordered. &#8220;Half speed ahead.
There&#8217;s someone alive on her....
Good <i>God</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>The heat, as the <i>Hudson</i> crept in,
dried their eyes till they were half
blinded by a blur of tears. Seen
through these, the light swung big in the
darkness. &#8220;Who is it? Who is it?&#8221;
they called.</p>

<p>A weak hail answered them. The
dripping fender of hemp on the nose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the <i>Hudson</i> touched the side of the
<i>Sachsen</i> and steamed on the hot metal.
Erect in the bows, drenched with the
spray of the hose, Moran cried in a voice
of suffocation, &#8220;Jump!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i063.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Dotted line shows passage of Keighley&#8217;s men from forward cargo room to shaft tunnel</i><br />
<i>They finally escaped through bunkers amidships beside the boilers and stoke holes</i></p>

<p>From the coal port above him a naked
figure squirmed out, hung kicking and
fell into his arms. Another and another
followed&mdash;Moran and his men catching
them as they came, and shouting encouragement
through the steam that
rose on all sides with the smell of
blistered paint. One man in the struggle
at the narrow opening, was thrown
into the water and had to be dragged
out with a boat hook. Others fell on
their feet, and, throwing themselves on
the deck with hoarse cries, began to roll
around in the spray. Lieutenant Moore
came down unconscious, as if baked stiff,
and lay crouched. Captain Keighley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
falling beside him, crawled with his
mouth open, to the nozzle of the spray.
&#8220;All off!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;Start&mdash;yer
water.... <i>Water!</i>&#8221;</p>



<p>Moran shouted, &#8220;Back off. Full
speed. Get these men to the hospital.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were madmen. And the squad
on the <i>Hudson</i>, fighting with them to
prevent them from jumping overboard,
had to carry them below to the engineer&#8217;s
quarters and wrap them in wet
blankets and hold them down.</p>

<p>Not one of them was in a condition to
tell how they had escaped. (Indeed
few of them ever succeeded in recalling
any more of what had happened in the
shaft tunnel than a convalescent remembers
of the delirium of his fever.)
Only Keighley&mdash;between the gulps of
water that were doled out to him cautiously&mdash;explained
that he had come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
his senses sitting with his back against
the door of the shaft tunnel, ankle deep
in water, and had realized that they
would all be drowned in the tunnel unless
they escaped to some higher level.
He had forced the steel door back and
driven or dragged the men out to the
engine room where they climbed to the
first tier of gratings, the fire in this part
of the boat having burned itself out
first, for want of fuel. From there, he
had found his way through the stokeholes
to an empty coal bunker, where a
cooler current of air warned him that
there was probably a coal port open up
above him. He had come back for the
others; they had climbed the bunker
ladders, and found the port; an engineer
had made the signal with a stoker&#8217;s
lamp; and the <i>Hudson</i> had seen it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
&#8220;Gi&#8217; me a drink,&#8221; Keighley ended.
&#8220;Gi&#8217; me a drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was the least exhausted of all the
crew&mdash;although the truth is that none of
them was more than dangerously blistered
and temporarily maddened by
pain. They were of the toughness that
is characteristic of their profession&mdash;chosen
men who got themselves injured
by the hundreds every year, but who
succumbed to their injuries so rarely
that the death rate of the department
was, at that time, only six men a year&mdash;trained
men who had the agility of cats
and a cat&#8217;s tenacity of life.</p>

<p>They were taken to their homes or to
the hospitals, in ambulances, &#8220;to lay up
for repairs.&#8221; Captain Keighley refused
to do even that. &#8220;I&#8217;m all right,&#8221;
he told the ambulance surgeons. &#8220;Put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
some grease on me&mdash;somethin&#8217; to take
the smart out. If I go home lookin&#8217;
sick, I&#8217;ll scare the girl to death.&#8221; (He
was a widower, living with a married
daughter whose husband was a police
captain.) &#8220;Fix up my hands. That&#8217;s
all I need.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had been burned about the head
and arms chiefly, and they washed and
bandaged him. They put his left arm
in a sling&mdash;much to his disgust&mdash;and
would have bound up his right hand, too,
if he had not refused to allow them.
&#8220;Let that alone,&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;I got
use for that.&#8221; They warned him that
he might have blood poisoning if he did
not protect his burns from the air,
&#8220;Huh!&#8221; he grunted. &#8220;Blood poisonin&#8217;!
Put somethin&#8217; on it so&#8217;s I can get
a night&#8217;s sleep. That&#8217;s all I need.&#8221;
And they had to let him have his way.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>He went upstairs to his bedroom and
lay down in his underclothes&mdash;because
it would have been too great an effort
to remove them&mdash;and slept the sleep of
exhaustion. He was not disturbed; the
<i>Hudson</i> had been reported out of commission
and no alarms were rung in.</p>

<p>He slept the sleep of exhaustion, and
he wakened next morning to the noises
made by an improvised crew at work
cleaning up the fire-boat. When he had
blinked away the first alarming idea that
he had overslept, he sat up painfully and
looked at the blisters on his free hand.
He looked at them a long time&mdash;as if he
saw there the whole story of his battle
with the &#8220;Jiggers&#8221;&mdash;and then he looked
up, under his eyebrows, at the open door
and the vacant cots of the crew&#8217;s bunkroom,
and he almost smiled. He
straightened up slowly, like a rheumatic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
as he stood; and he went about his toilet
with a cripple&#8217;s patience, his mind on
the &#8220;Jiggers&#8221; and their discomfiture&mdash;considering
what they would do next.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN he came down stairs to the
&#8220;office,&#8221; he found Deputy-Chief
Moran waiting to see him, and he received
Moran as if nothing unusual had
been happening, despite the fact that his
left arm was still in its support. Moran
had a morning newspaper on the desk,
spread at a page that held a portrait of
Captain Keighley and an account of the
fire on the <i>Sachsen</i>. He greeted Keighley
with congratulations, as pugilists
shake hands before they come to blows.</p>

<p>Keighley glanced at the paper, indifferently.
&#8220;We didn&#8217;t stay in the engine
room,&#8221; he corrected the account.
&#8220;We were in the shaft tunnel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moran was full-blooded and dark-haired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
His mouth was harsh under a
wiry black mustache that looked as if
it had been bitten off at the teeth. He
asked, curtly, &#8220;How did you get into
that mess?&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley dropped the paper in the
waste basket before he replied, &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t get into it. I got out of it.&#8221; He
confronted Moran with a defiant eye.
&#8220;There was some funny work at the
bottom of it. The men in the tunnel
seemed to think it was Moore an&#8217; his
gang.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moore&#8217;s gang, of course, was also Moran&#8217;s.
And Moran demanded, &#8220;Did
they say so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what do <i>you</i> say so for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yuh <i>asked</i> me, didn&#8217;t yuh?&#8221; Keighley
replied, unperturbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked you for facts!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what yuh&#8217;re goin&#8217; to get&mdash;if
yuh want to hear them. Those men
know. <i>They can tell.</i> I&#8217;m not int&#8217;rested&mdash;unless
someone wants to make
trouble fer me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Who</i> wants to make trouble for
you?&#8221; Moran blustered.</p>

<p>Keighley replied, with meaning,
&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m waitin&#8217; to find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Deputy-Chief had come there intending
to hold over Keighley the threat
of an investigation. He found, now,
that Keighley had the butt end of that
whip in his hand. He said roughly,
&#8220;Look here, Keighley, you might as well
understand first as last, the order for
Chief Borden&#8217;s retirement&#8217;s coming.
You know which side your bread&#8217;s buttered
on, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Without an instant&#8217;s hesitation,
Keighley put his hand down flat on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
desk-top and answered, &#8220;I stand pat.
I don&#8217;t owe <i>youse</i> nothin&#8217;. Yuh can do
what yuh like, but yuh can&#8217;t scare me.
See?&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew that he was safe for the time,
for he had the prestige of the morning&#8217;s
newspaper notoriety behind him, and
the Commissioner would not dare to remove
him without cause, and any attempt
to make a case against him out
of the fire on the <i>Sachsen</i> would prove&mdash;in
the language of politics&mdash;&#8220;a boomerang.&#8221;
The charges against Chief
Borden had been held proven by the
Commissioner, but they had yet to be
defended before a court of appeal under
the Civil Service laws. Public sentiment
had been aroused in the chief&#8217;s
favor by the arbitrary and insolent conduct
of the Commissioner sitting in
judgment at the trial. And Keighley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
calculated that if the order were issued
for the chief&#8217;s retirement, the &#8220;Jiggers,&#8221;
to obtain that order, would have
to fling themselves into a blow that
would take, for the moment, all their
strength.</p>

<p>Moran took up his cap from the desk
and put it on. &#8220;All right, Keighley,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see what we can do for
<i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley turned his back to reach his
coat that hung on a hook beside the
window. When he looked around, Moran
had gone. He resumed possession
of his office with a frowning glance
about him, and then went out to the
pier to inspect the work that had been
done on the <i>Hudson</i>.</p>

<p>The quarrel in the fire-department
was less political than personal; for, of
course, both &#8220;Jiggers&#8221; and &#8220;Anti-Jiggers&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
were adherents of Tammany Hall.
It was a quarrel between the old chief,
Borden, and the new Fire Commissioner,
who was in some degree indebted
to the &#8220;Jiggers&#8221; for his appointment;
they had used their &#8220;voice and influence&#8221;
for him with &#8220;the Boss&#8221;; Chief
Borden had objected to their doing so,
and had used his position to make life
uneasy for their leaders, among whom
was Deputy-Chief Moran. The quarrel
had passed down from the officers to
the men; Captain Keighley had undertaken
to stop it in his company by preferring
charges against the malcontent
Doherty and having him &#8220;broken&#8221; by
the chief; and this unexpected action
had uncovered a whole conspiracy
against him with Lieutenant Moore at
its head.</p>

<p>Now, if Chief Borden were retired by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
order of the Commissioner, Keighley
would be left without a friend in power;
Moran would be made chief; and the
full revenge of Keighley&#8217;s enemies
would fall upon him. He had no hope
of avoiding it. He had no intention of
trying to conciliate it. He was resolved
merely to fight&mdash;after the manner of his
kind&mdash;and to attend to his duties on
the <i>Hudson</i> as thoroughly as possible,
meanwhile, so that there might be no
valid excuse for removing him from his
command.</p>

<p>It was in this spirit that he received
his men as they returned one by one to
their work&mdash;and relieved the strangers
who had been detailed in their places
while they were in the hospital&mdash;and
settled down again to pierhouse routine.
&#8220;Shine&#8221; Conlin was the first to reappear,
and he reported to the captain with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
a sort of hangdog shamefacedness; but
Keighley&mdash;old, cold and silent&mdash;showed
no sign of remembering the part the
little wharf-rat had played aboard the
<i>Sachsen</i>, and &#8220;Shine&#8221; resumed possession
of his locker and his bunk, with the
abashed grin of a guilty schoolboy who
is allowed to return to his place in his
class under suspended sentence. Sturton&mdash;&#8220;The
Turr&#8217;ble Turk&#8221;&mdash;came
eagerly, having a clear conscience; and
he was a little crestfallen after his reception;
whereas the sly and sandy
Cripps accepted the captain&#8217;s manner
as a tribute to his own powers of concealment
and winked to himself in secret
self-congratulation as he came out of the
office, his eyes on his feet. The loyal
Farley looked blank. The others behaved
according to their natures and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
their degrees of innocence or guilt.
Only Lieutenant Moore&mdash;the last to arrive,
very pale and shaken&mdash;received
any intimation that Keighley had not
forgotten what had occurred; and he
received it in the captain&#8217;s refusal to allow
him to write the company&#8217;s reports,
as he had been accustomed.</p>

<p>Life in the pierhouse, between fires,
was as dull as imprisonment. There
were brasses to be polished, hose to be
dried, and a watch to be kept on the
&#8220;jigger&#8221;&mdash;the little bell that rang in
the alarms; but when the chores for the
day had been done, all the rest was idleness.
As long as there were strangers
in the company, there was some show of
sociability in the sitting-room, but when
the entire crew had returned to duty,
whether they worked or idled, it was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
a constrained silence, with side-mouthed
whispers and a suspicious
aloofness between group and group.</p>

<p>There was little said about the fire on
the <i>Sachsen</i> even within the groups.
Firemen have no more taste for discussing
their day&#8217;s work with one another
than any other laborers have; and in
this case, there was an uneasy feeling
that the man who said least, now, would
have least to answer for if there were
to be an official investigation of the
disaster. As for Keighley, he did not
ask himself&mdash;or anybody else&mdash;what was
going on in the minds of either faction.
He did not ask, from either, anything
but obedience; and he got that, now,
without perceptible difficulty. They
had evidently acquired some sort of unholy
respect for him; and if they were
plotting against him, they were doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
it hypocritically. He was satisfied, if
it had not been for the difficulty of making
out the daily reports.</p>

<p>It was as if to make that difficulty
greater that the engineer of the <i>Hudson</i>
came to him to complain of the trouble
it was to keep the boat&#8217;s low-pressure
cylinder warm and ready to start. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t see the sense o&#8217; puttin&#8217; triple-expansion
engines into a fire-boat, any
way,&#8221; he reported. &#8220;That third cylinder&#8217;s
just a drag on the other two. She
goes cold here, layin&#8217; in the dock, an&#8217;
we&#8217;re half way to a fire before she gets
hot enough to handle the steam.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley replied, &#8220;Well, send in yer
kick to headquarters&#8221;&mdash;and avoided
Dady&#8217;s eye as he said it; for it was the
captain&#8217;s duty to make all such reports.</p>

<p>The engineer looked at him, looked at
the floor, and then rubbed his nose with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the back of an oily hand. &#8220;I guess <i>you</i>
better do it, cap&#8217;n,&#8221; he said meekly. &#8220;I
ain&#8217;t much of an ink-slinger.&#8221; And
Keighley&#8217;s greater sense of dignity compelled
him to answer, with an affected
indifference, &#8220;All right. All right.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when he shut the door of his office
and took out his pocket Webster
from the locked drawer in which he kept
it&mdash;with as much secrecy as if it were a
rhyming dictionary&mdash;he sat down before
his official letter paper to nurse his jaw
with no more dignity than a schoolboy.
He began to screw out the tortuous
scrawl of his report, breathing hard at
the end of every line and muttering
curses at the beginning of the next; and
when he decided that he had come to the
end of his first sentence, he put down his
pen to relax the muscles of his mouth
and wipe his forehead and swear angrily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
at Moore for having failed him. The
<i>Hudson</i> cuddling up against the pier,
purring a little fume of steam from the
exhaust pipe, was roused from her rest
every now and then by the engineer in
charge turning over the engines to get
the water out of the low-pressure cylinder.
And in the sitting-room Lieutenant
Moore was tilted back against the
wall in a cane chair, reading a newspaper,
looking over his sheet at the
closed door of the office with an expression
of sulky resentment, and with the
same expression glancing aside at the
men who were reading, loafing and playing
dominoes around him.</p>

<p>There was nothing of the genial atmosphere
of an engine house&#8217;s leisure
hour about the scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; had confided, in a husky
undertone, to the freckled Cripps beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
him, &#8220;I s&#8217;pose Moore&#8217;s sore &#8217;cause
we won&#8217;t fight it out to a finish fer &#8217;m.
What&#8217;d <i>we</i> make by it, supposin&#8217; we got
th&#8217; ol&#8217; man trun out of his job, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cripps shut his eyes and nodded
solemnly. He was still &#8220;lying low.&#8221;</p>

<p>At a round table in the center of the
room, Farley, of the curled mustache,
was playing dominoes with Sturton,
&#8220;The Turr&#8217;ble Turk;&#8221; and Farley, being
an expert, could loll back in his chair
and play absent-mindedly; while Sturton,
to whom the game was an almost
violent mental exercise, bent over his
dominoes, with his big-boned face set in
a worried scowl, playing deliberately,
with slow movements of his hairy paws.</p>

<p>Farley had been watching Lieutenant
Moore. &#8220;That loot&#8217;nt looks like a bullpup
shut out on a door-step,&#8221; he summed
it up to Sturton. But &#8220;Turk&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
merely grunted, without letting his attention
be drawn from the game; and
they continued to play in silence&mdash;waiting,
as the whole department was waiting,
for the retirement of Chief Borden
and its consequences.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THEY were waiting so, one night,
when the next water-front blaze
came to relieve the monotony of their
inaction. At the first stroke of the
jigger Keighley laid down his pen and
brightened with the hope that there was
a fire in his district to release him from
his desk. Lieutenant Moore dropped
his newspaper and looked up to count
the strokes of the bell with an expression
of relief. The men straightened
back from their dominoes; and when
the little bell started to ring the third
number of a station in their district,
they rose with a smile. With the first
stroke of the larger gong, the sitting-room
was empty&mdash;Captain Keighley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
was shouting to the pilot, &#8220;All right
there! Pier &mdash;&mdash;, North River!&#8221;&mdash;and
the <i>Hudson</i> was under way.</p>

<p>They found the river as crowded with
a summer evening&#8217;s traffic as Broadway
with street-cars and hansoms on a
theatre night; and the <i>Hudson</i> had no
shore engine&#8217;s right of way under the
law. She went whistling up the stream,
dodging and spurting, throbbing, grunting
and checking speed. Blazing excursion
boats, bedecked with colored
lights, answered her impatient signals
with cheerful impudence and held their
courses. Squat ferries paddled serenely
across her path. A tug cut in ahead
of her to race with her for salvage, and
worried her like a cur at a horse&#8217;s head.
The pilot twirled his wheel, worked his
engine room signals, and swore despairingly.
And Captain Keighley, staring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
at the shore lights in the distance, revolved
the first sentence of his report
in memory, and vainly tried to forget
it.</p>

<p>When the river opened into a free
stretch of water, the tug fell behind;
and Keighley saw the pier-end lamp&mdash;towards
which they were heading&mdash;blinking
like the intermittent flash of
a lighthouse. It disappeared, and he
guessed that it had been blotted out by
the drift of smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wind from the south?&#8221; he asked.
The pilot answered, &#8220;Yes&#8217;r.&#8221; Keighley
said, &#8220;Take us in on this side o&#8217; the
pier.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped out of the wheelhouse to
go aft to the crew. &#8220;Get out two two-inch
lines from the port gates,&#8221; he
ordered Lieutenant Moore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; came running back from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
bows and joined the men who were taking
the hose from its metal-sheathed
box. &#8220;Banana fritters fer ours,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the fruit pier!&#8221; And
Keighley observed that some of the men
laughed, that the others at least smiled,
and that Lieutenant Moore was the only
one who remained out of reach of the
invitation to good humor. The captain
returned forward again, frowning
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>The pier shed, as they swung in
towards it, was fuming at every door
with puffs of a heavy smoke from the
burning grasses in which the fruit was
packed; and Keighley saw that the fire
was going to be&mdash;in department slang&mdash;a
&#8220;worker.&#8221; He could see the &#8220;steamers&#8221;
of two shore companies drawing
water from the end of the slip. He understood
that their crews were in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
shed, trying to drive the fire forward;
and he knew that it would be his duty
to enter from the other end of the pier
and catch the flames between the two
attacks.</p>

<p>He shouted to the pilot, &#8220;Hol&#8217; us
up to the door there!&#8221; He ran back
to Lieutenant Moore. &#8220;Stay aboard
here,&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;If the blaze shows
in the roof, take the top off her with
the monitor. Go slow, though. Don&#8217;t
bring it down onto us.&#8221; He called to
the men, &#8220;Throw out yer lines! Make
fast, now! Hang on to that line aft!
Hol&#8217; it! Hol&#8217; it.... All right.
Stretch in. In through the door here!
Come on!&#8221;</p>

<p>He jumped up on the bulwarks as the
engines reversed with a frantic churning
astern. And then he saw a flicker
of flame glimmer and grow between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
timbers of the cribwork, just above the
water line, half way up the dock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hol&#8217; on!&#8221; he cried to the four men
who had leaped to the pier. &#8220;Drop one
o&#8217; those lines. Take yer axes. Chop
a hole in the floor planks inside. The
fire&#8217;s &#8217;n underneath.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men who were aboard the <i>Hudson</i>
tossed the axes out to the others,
and these rushed into the smoke, dragging
the single line of hose. Keighley
said to the Lieutenant, &#8220;Go in an&#8217; take
charge there. See &#8217;at no one gets lost
in that smoke.&#8221; Moore scrambled to
the pier, and the captain ran forward
along the bulwarks, peering down for
an opening between the stringers of
the cribbing.</p>

<p>He knew that the crew on the pier
would take at least ten minutes to cut
a hole through the three-inch planks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
in the blind suffocation of that shed;
and meanwhile, the fire would travel
from end to end of the pier. He could
see no opening larger than an inch slit
between the foot timbers beside the bow
of the boat. He started aft again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine,&#8221; behind him, said, &#8220;It&#8217;s
covered at high water, cap.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley spun around. &#8220;What is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The hole. I t&#8217;ought&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley jumped down at him.
&#8220;Where is it? Will it take a line o&#8217;
hose in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; said. &#8220;It&#8217;ll take a
bunch o&#8217; bananas in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s about there.&#8221; He pointed
down the pier. &#8220;It&#8217;s &#8217;n under water at
high tide.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley ran his fingers up the buttons
of his rubber coat, and it fell off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
him like sleight-of-hand. His helmet
dropped beside it. &#8220;Get me a heavin&#8217;-line,&#8221;
he said. And &#8220;Shine&#8221; gasped
excitedly, &#8220;Say, cap, <i>you</i> can&#8217;t find it.
Yuh have to dive. It&#8217;s where the &#8216;club&#8217;
ust to hide the stuff we swiped&mdash;till the
cop got next t&#8217; it. I c&#8217;u&#8217;d make it in
the dark. We fixed up a reg&#8217;lar joint
in there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain said, &#8220;Peel off, then.
Hi, there! Bring us a heavin&#8217;-line&#8221;&mdash;and
ran back to get it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; dropped to the deck with a
chuckle and began a race for &#8220;first in,&#8221;
gurgling an excited profanity as he
kicked off his rubber boots. Diving on
the water-front, on a midsummer night,
was a way of earning a living that appealed
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beat y&#8217; in, Turk,&#8221; he challenged.
&#8220;Come on. Saturday&#8217;s wash-day.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>&#8220;Turk&#8221; asked cautiously, &#8220;What&#8217;s
on?&#8221; He had an instinctive distrust of
&#8220;Shine&#8221; as a type, as well as an acquired
distrust of him as a &#8220;Jigger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nuthin&#8217; &#8217;s on,&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; said as he
came out of his blue flannel shirt and
stood up, grinning, naked. &#8220;Where&#8217;s
the rope?&#8221;</p>

<p>Farley, from behind, tied one line
under his arms. Captain Keighley gave
him the end of another. &#8220;That&#8217;s fer
signalin&#8217;,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Jerk it
three times if yuh want us to haul y&#8217;
out. Jerk it twice if yuh&#8217;re all right
an&#8217; ready to take in the house. We&#8217;ll
tie this other one to the pipe. Jerk
once to start the water. Over yuh go
now!... Strip!&#8221; he said to
Cripps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; sprang upon the bulwarks,
took the signaling-line between his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
teeth, and dived. He struck the water
and went in as clean as a fish. A few
bubbles rose and burst in the streak of
light from the wheelhouse window.
The lines paid out smoothly through
Keighley&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>They stopped&mdash;and he began to
gather in the slack, stealthily. They
jerked forward, and ran out with a
rush. There was the pause of a crisis.
Then the signal-line jumped twice, and
Keighley cried, &#8220;He&#8217;s in! Give him
the pipe! Light up there!&#8221; Cripps
tossed the nozzle overboard, and the
others ran aft to lighten up the hose.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;SHINE&#8221; had wriggled through
the opening in the timbers and
risen under the floor of the pier in a
dense smoke that was lit with flames.
He had swum to a slimy cross-beam and
straddled it to draw a deep breath
through a crack in the cribbing. And
now he was hauling in the line, hand
over hand, choking and sputtering.
The nozzle rose between his knees. He
jerked once on the signal rope, heard
Keighley&#8217;s muffled cry of &#8220;Start yer
water!&#8221; and threw himself on his belly
on the nozzle and the beam. The air
gushed in a mighty sough from the pipe.
The hose bucked and kicked up under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
him. The stream spurted from it and
broke, hissing, on the blaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go it!&#8221; he said, through his teeth,
riding the hose and clinging to the
slippery timbers. &#8220;Go it yuh son of a
mut!&#8221;</p>

<p>He had left the weight of discipline
on the deck behind him with his uniform,
and he had returned to the naked
audacity of the days when he had
obeyed no rules but those of the &#8220;club.&#8221;
He was no longer a fireman; he was a
young hoodlum enjoying an adventure,
and he looked up at the blaze before him
with a grin. He heard Lieutenant
Moore&#8217;s squad chopping at the planks
above him, and he listened contemptuously.
He thought of Captain Keighley,
and it was with the admiring
thought of a younger &#8220;Shine&#8221; for the
leader of his gang.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>He was still clinging to his beam
when Cripps rose blowing behind him,
having followed up the trail of the hose.
But the flame and smoke had already
been driven back sufficiently to clear the
air; and &#8220;Shine&#8221; greeted the freckled
&#8220;Jigger&#8221; with jubilant curses. &#8220;Come
on here, Cripsey!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;We got
her beat to a stan&#8217; still. Take a hold o&#8217;
the spout. We&#8217;ll slush it around.&#8221;
And when Cripps swam up beside him
and threw his weight on the pipe,
&#8220;Shine&#8221; shouted in the generous exultation
of the moment, &#8220;Listen to
Moore up there, tappin&#8217; on them planks
like a footy woodpecker.... Slush
her over in the corner there....
The cap&#8217;s too wise fer <i>him</i>. He&#8217;s too
damn hard-headed an ol&#8217; clinker fer
Moore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cripps blinked the water out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
eyes and replied guardedly, &#8220;There&#8217;s
nuthin&#8217; in it fer us, any how.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a better man&#8217;n Moore, all
right, all right,&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; repeated.
&#8220;We&#8217;d been all burned to blisters in the
bottom o&#8217; that Dutch cotton-tub if it
hadn&#8217;t been fer him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s where Moore fell
down,&#8221; Cripps answered at the top of
his voice. &#8220;He was scared stiff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The damn ol&#8217; clinker!&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221;
said-referring to the captain. &#8220;That&#8217;s
a good name fer him, eh? &#8216;Ol&#8217; Clinkers,&#8217;
eh?&#8221; And they were laughing together
in a sort of cowed respect and
admiration for Keighley when they
heard him say gruffly, behind them,
&#8220;Play that stream lower, along the cribwork.
Them timbers is afire outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; ducked his head, and then
looked over his shoulder. The old man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
reached an arm to the pipe and growled,
&#8220;To yer right. To yer right.&#8221;</p>

<p>They applied themselves to their
work like a pair of schoolboys caught
idling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good enough,&#8221; Keighley said at
last. &#8220;Keep that stream off me, now.&#8221;
And climbing over the beam, he swam
forward into the fading glow of the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hully gee!&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; said. &#8220;I
wonder if he caught on.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had &#8220;caught on.&#8221; He understood
that those two men had been the
leaders, under Moore, of the attempt to
drive him from the company; and he
understood from their talk that Moore&#8217;s
followers had deserted him. He snorted
the salt water from his nose; Mister
Moore&#8217;s claws were cut, then, sure
enough. Well&mdash;</p>

<p>At the next cross-beam he saw that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the fire was blazing far ahead of him
in a sort of flooring of loose planks; and
he could make out what seemed to be
two carpenter&#8217;s horses covered with
boards for a table, some boxes for stools,
and a pile of burning straw that had
been bedding. He swam back to bring
the men, and found Farley and &#8220;Turk&#8221;
Sturton splashing up with a second
line of hose. He ordered them in with
it as impassively as though he were in
full uniform on the deck of the <i>Hudson</i>
instead of straddling a sunken beam,
the water trickling into his eyes from
his grey hair, dressed in dripping underclothes
and commanding four nude
firemen who grinned at one another
when he turned his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut off that pipe,&#8221; he said to
&#8220;Shine,&#8221; &#8220;an&#8217; light up on this other
line.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>He led them&mdash;splashing and laughing
and tugging on their hose&mdash;into the
drip of hot water from the lines of the
shore companies above them. The
stream from one of the <i>Hudson&#8217;s</i> standpipes,
dashing against the burning
timbers outside, blew stinging sheets of
spray through the slits of the cribbing
on them. The warm smoke puffed back
at them in stifling clouds. &#8220;Turk-ish
b-bath,&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; gasped. &#8220;Ouch!
Gee! That about parboiled me lef&#8217; lug!
Gi&#8217; me air! Gi&#8217; me air!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i103.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;<i>I&#8217;ll brain any man that tries to open this door before I give the word</i>&#8221;</p>

<p class="center">See page 40</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; Keighley ordered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turk&#8221; Sturton followed the voice of
authority. &#8220;Shine&#8221; followed the voice
of the man. Cripps obeyed where
obedience had been proved the wiser
policy. Farley went to do the work for
which he was paid. Their obedience
drew them together like a yoke; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
helped one another, rubbed shoulders
facing a common enemy, and touched
hands in an almost friendly sympathy,
sharing one task and one danger.</p>



<p>They stopped when the hose would
come no farther, and Sturton sent back
the signal for water. &#8220;Some Guinny
had a roost in there,&#8221; Farley said,
peering through his fingers at the
flames.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; replied, &#8220;&#8217;Tust to be the
gang&#8217;s club-house. There she goes!&#8221;
He shouted, above the noise of the
stream, &#8220;She ain&#8217;t insured, at that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley rested his elbows on a beam,
rubbed his smarting eyes, and grunted
half-disgustedly. To him &#8220;Shine&#8217;s&#8221;
playfulness was the ingratiating gamboling
of a dog that had tried to bite
him. He felt no inclination to pat the
treacherous cur; but neither did he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
purpose to kick him. To Farley
&#8220;Shine&#8221; seemed to show a spirit of
good-fellowship that let bygones be bygones
and reduced their relations to the
merely human intercourse of man and
man. To Sturton, absorbed in his
duties, it was the encouragement of a
kindred spirit who took the joy of
battle more noisily than he.</p>

<p>The blaze, caught at close range,
seemed to snuff out as suddenly as if it
had been no more than the flame of a
candle; and when Keighley looked back
over his shoulder in the darkness, he
saw the spark of a belated lantern
which Lieutenant Moore was lowering
through the hole that his squad had cut
in the floor. &#8220;There&#8217;s the loot&#8217;nt,&#8221;
&#8220;Shine&#8221; sang out impudently. &#8220;If he
ain&#8217;t careful with that lamp he&#8217;ll set
fire to somethin&#8217;.&#8221; And the laugh that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
followed came heartily from the men.</p>

<p>Keighley made his way back to the
lantern and called to Moore to put a
ladder down. &#8220;Fire&#8217;s out here,&#8221; he
shouted. &#8220;Go in up there an&#8217; help wet
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited at the foot of the ladder
until he was sure that the last glimmer
of flame had been extinguished below;
then, calling to his own squad to leave
their lines and &#8220;back out,&#8221; he climbed
the ladder to the floor of the pier.</p>

<p>There was no one there to laugh at his
ridiculous appearance, except the wharf
watchman, who had returned to the
scene of the fire from the safety of a
car-float in a neighboring slip. Keighley
strode over to him. &#8220;Got any ripe
bananas yuh don&#8217;t want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; the man replied. &#8220;Take all
youse can ate.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>&#8220;Shine&#8221; came up the ladder, panting
from a race with Sturton. Keighley
touched him on the bare shoulder.
&#8220;Take a bunch o&#8217; those bananas aboard
with yuh,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;an&#8217; be damn
quick about it.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">TWENTY minutes later, the last
of the fire had been drowned out;
the <i>Hudson&#8217;s</i> lines had all been picked
up; and the crew sat along the bulwarks,
eating bananas and waiting for the
order to start back to their house.
Cripps and Sturton, &#8220;Shine&#8221; and Farley
were perched in a row along the edge
of the engine-room skylight, &#8220;in their
birthday clo&#8217;s,&#8221; each with a banana in
his hand and a bulge in his cheek,
fraternizing while they dried.</p>

<p>Sturton was saying, with an air of
ownership, &#8220;She&#8217;s a peach of a boat,
jus&#8217; the same. We c&#8217;u&#8217;d&#8217;ve swamped
out that blaze ourselves, if there hadn&#8217;t
been a steamer on the island.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>&#8220;Shine,&#8221; blinking watery-eyed, condemned
the fire in resentful anathemas
and bit savagely on the banana.
&#8220;Damn scorch burned my pipes so I
can&#8217;t taste nuthin&#8217;,&#8221; he complained.</p>

<p>Farley, with the tears still running
down his cheeks, swung his heels blissfully,
chewed, and regarded the lights
of the city. &#8220;It&#8217;s hot work,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s hot work, all right. But how&#8217;d
yuh like to be pushin&#8217; a pen in one o&#8217;
them little furnaces, fer instance?&#8221;
He nodded at the late lights in the upper
windows of a distant office building.
&#8220;One o&#8217; them newspaper touts was tryin&#8217;
to pump me th&#8217;other day about that
fire in the cotton. &#8216;Say,&#8217; he says, &#8216;what
takes you men into the fire department?&#8217;
&#8216;Oh, the pay,&#8217; I says. &#8216;The
pay.&#8217; &#8216;Hell!&#8217; he says, &#8216;the money&#8217;s no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
good to a dead man. Look at Bresnan.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The damn mut!&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; put in.
&#8220;&#8217;T&#8217;wasn&#8217;t Bresnan&#8217;s fault he got
nipped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t mean it that way,&#8221; Cripps
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how <i>did</i> he mean it?&#8221;
&#8220;Shine&#8221; demanded.</p>

<p>Farley waved his banana skin at the
high building. &#8220;He meant &#8217;at when it
comes to this sort o&#8217; bus&#8217;ness he&#8217;d
sooner be settin&#8217; up in one o&#8217; them hen-coops
peckin&#8217; at an ink bottle an&#8217;
scratchin&#8217; at a desk.&#8221; He gave a grotesque
imitation of a clerk humped over
his work, dipping his pen frantically,
and writing, with his nose to the paper.</p>

<p>Cripps laughed and threw his banana
at the pier. &#8220;To the woods with him!&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
he said. &#8220;Gi&#8217;me a banana that&#8217;s ripe.
That last one tasted like a varnish
shop.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Keighley rose, in his uniform,
from the ladder of the engine
room behind them, and caught the
general smile. He heard Cripps say,
&#8220;This suits me all right.&#8221; There were
satisfied grunts of assent from the
others. At the stern, Lieutenant Moore
sat somewhat apart, spitting over the
rail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get yer clothes on,&#8221; Keighley
ordered gruffly. &#8220;Cast off there,
Moore!&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the <i>Hudson</i> was spinning
back leisurely to her quarters with a
trail of banana skins in her wake, he
said to his lieutenant in the wheel house,
&#8220;I want yuh to see th&#8217; engineer to-morrah
an&#8217; write a report to headquarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
on that low pressure cylinder
bus&#8217;ness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moore looked up to find the cool grey
eyes fixed on him in a calculation of how
much enmity there was left in him. He
flushed. &#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; he said, almost
gratefully.</p>

<p>Keighley turned away before he
added with an effect of kindliness, &#8220;All
right. Dady&#8217;ll explain about it to yuh
to-morrah. Go out an&#8217; tell those boys
we want some bananas in here. I guess
we&#8217;re smoked as dry as they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not that Keighley felt the impulse
of any unguarded generosity.
He knew his fire-department too well
for <i>that</i>! For there is this peculiarity
in firemen: being free of any business
worries or other anxieties concerning
their incomes, they spend their days in
efforts to &#8220;get even,&#8221; to avenge slights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
and repay friendships. They are men
of no philosophy, unable to get outside
of themselves into any calm view of
their troubles, incapable of forgiving an
injury and unable to understand such a
capability in others; and they despise
particularly the &#8220;quitter&#8221; and the &#8220;ingrate.&#8221;
Keighley did not wish to be
sneered at, by his men, as a &#8220;quitter&#8221;;
and he knew that if Moran did not help
the &#8220;Jiggers&#8221; in their quarrel with
their captain, they would consider the
deputy-chief an &#8220;ingrate.&#8221; The fight
was &#8220;to a finish,&#8221; whatever interludes
of good-natured fellowship might happen
to relieve it.</p>

<p>Keighley knew it. He merely accepted
the truce in the spirit of a
&#8220;game&#8221; antagonist who could fight
without malice and win without spite.</p>

<p>He saw the boat berthed, watched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
men go off to their beds, and then
turned in himself&mdash;relieved to be free
of his daily reports&mdash;with a feeling that
the truce would last over the next day,
at least, which was Sunday.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the morning it was announced in
the newspapers that Chief Borden
had been suspended, pending the decision
of the courts on the charges against
him, and that Moran had been appointed
acting-chief in his place.
Keighley opened his eyes wide upon
the news, and then narrowed them cunningly
as he considered it. He had expected
that Borden would be thrown out
neck and crop as a warning to all the
&#8220;Anti-Jiggers;&#8221; and there was a glimmer
of something hopeful in the half-heartedness
of a tentative suspension.
Keighley shut himself in his office with
his desk telephone to find out what had
happened.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>It did not take him long to learn.
One of his political friends in the upper
circle explained that &#8220;the Boss&#8221; had
objected to a fratricidal war that
threatened to disrupt the whole fire department,
to sacrifice public faith in the
administration for no political ends,
and to weaken the &#8220;organization&#8221; by
dividing it against itself. The Fire
Commissioner had compromised by suspending
Borden instead of &#8220;breaking&#8221;
him. Keighley listened&mdash;and shook his
head. &#8220;That don&#8217;t let <i>me</i> out,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It may keep &#8217;em from comin&#8217; after me
on Broadway with a club, but it&#8217;ll never
keep &#8217;em from stickin&#8217; me in the back
some night around a dark corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and
scratched the back of his neck doubtfully.
It was his day off duty, but he
was reluctant to take it&mdash;and leave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
lieutenant in charge. &#8220;Moore,&#8221; he
summoned him, &#8220;get that report done,
will yuh? I&#8217;ll see to cleanin&#8217; the boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Moore replied. &#8220;I
can do both&mdash;if you want to get away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley looked out the window at
the humid haze of heat that hung over
the water. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll be as cool here
as anywhere,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Go ahead
with the report.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That Sunday was to be memorable in
the records of the Weather Bureau as
the hottest July day in forty years; and
it was to be memorable in the records
of the fire department for the most
dangerous fire that had attacked the
water front since the department had
been formed. But the fire did not break
out till sundown; and fate, while she
was setting a terrific stage for Keighley&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
next appearance, allowed him one
of those entre-acts that make the fireman&#8217;s
life such a thing of heart-breaking
spurts of action and nerve-wracking
blanks of peace.</p>

<p>Having given his orders for the day,
he withdrew, upstairs, to a balcony off
his bunkroom, where he sat all morning
in the shade, watching the tugs and ferries,
steamboats, floats and scows that
bustled and wallowed and staggered
past, squealing in a shrill impatience
when they whistled, and puffing short
of breath when they reversed. The
water under their bows broke and fell
back sluggishly. The swells in their
wakes reeled away with an oily roll.
The air was heavy with the drifting
belch of their funnels.</p>

<p>It could not be said that Keighley
really thought of anything while he sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
there. It was one of the characteristics
of his mind that it worked best under
the conditions of bewildering excitement
that make clear thought impossible to
most men. He did not even think about
the &#8220;Jiggers;&#8221; he merely snoozed, with
one eye on that matter, like a watchdog,
until the noonday sun drove him from
his balcony. Then he went sleepily to a
neighboring restaurant for his dinner,
having already telephoned that he would
not be home.</p>

<p>It was a blistering afternoon, with a
sun overhead that struck a quivering
refraction from the dried and warped
planks of the wharves, and a breeze that
came hot across the sparkle of the bay
where the glancing facets of small waves
shone like a million gleaming little mirrors.
The pierhouse stood at the
water&#8217;s edge, as bare as a lighthouse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the beat and reflection of the heat,
its row of open windows gaping in the
sunlight like a line of gasping mouths.
The men idled interminably, reading the
papers, yawning for an interval and
then reading them all over again. And
Keighley dozed at his desk in his office&mdash;like
Napoleon before a battle!&mdash;waiting
for the attack of his enemy to develop
the plan of his counter-assault.</p>

<p>A stiff easterly breeze sprang up at
sunset. It came cool from the sea; and
the crew of the <i>Hudson</i> received it as
a grateful relief. But this same breeze&mdash;puffing
steadily into the smolder of a
small fire that had just broken out in
the lumber yard of a furniture factory
on the East River water front&mdash;blew the
flames back through the stacks of seasoned
boards like a blaze through kindlings;
and while the <i>Hudson</i>, in answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
to a delayed alarm, was rounding the
Battery and speeding up the river, the
flames spread eagerly, in spite of all the
efforts of the shore companies to check
them, till, by the time the <i>Hudson</i> arrived,
they covered as much ground as
a prairie fire. Under a volume of dense
smoke, they reached and writhed and
leaped together, darting up their heads
venomously, waving aloft their flickering
crests, coiling back and striking low.
When the wind lifted the pall that
covered their trail, the piles of lumber
could be seen burning like torches. In
front of them, every now and then, a
feathery stream rose white in the ruddy
glow, spitting impotently into the air as
the firemen, retreating, choked it and
dragged it back; and overhead, continually,
the triumphal sparks brightened
and soared.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>At the first sight of them Keighley&#8217;s
indolence of mind disappeared with the
quick blink of an alert eye. &#8220;Aha!&#8221; he
said to himself. &#8220;There&#8217;s work for
Moran.&#8221; He shouted to the men, &#8220;Get
out ev&#8217;ry line we got, boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laid the <i>Hudson</i> broadside on, at
the head of the slip, between two
wharves, under the dark wall of the furniture
factory; and he led up three lines
of his largest hose to take the fire in the
rear. He left the boat empty except for
the pilot, standing black in the door of
the lighted wheelhouse, and quiet except
when Dady, the engineer, came up
from the engine room, looked across the
darkness towards the struggle which he
could not see, and called out to the pilot,
&#8220;How&#8217;s she goin&#8217;, Pete?&#8221;</p>

<p>The pilot answered several times, indifferently,
that she was &#8220;going her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
gait all right,&#8221; that she was &#8220;chasing
the boys all round the lot,&#8221; that she had
&#8220;the bit in her teeth.&#8221; But at length
he reported that the wind had fallen.
Then, the next time, he said, &#8220;She&#8217;s
puffing in from the southeast.&#8221; And
at last he leaned his shoulder against
the door-jamb and replied, &#8220;You better
get your pumps well greased. The
wind&#8217;s come round strong from the
south.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;South!&#8221; Dady sniffed the air.
&#8220;That&#8217;ll bring her back this way!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m telling you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The engineer popped into the hatch
like a frightened rabbit into its burrow;
and the silhouette in the doorway raised
the shadow of a pair of night glasses to
the black profile of a nose and stood
watching.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i125.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>The scene of the fire on the piers</i></p>

<p>In a moment, out of the darkness at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the head of the slip, two figures in long
rubber coats came striding into the light
of the incandescent lamp at the stern
of the <i>Hudson</i> and sprang aboard.
They were Captain Keighley and Acting-Chief
Moran; and they came forward
rapidly towards the wheelhouse,
Moran waving his arm with an excited
gesture of authority.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s working back over there,&#8221; he
was saying of the fire. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to
hold her, here, at the factory, and keep
her from jumping that street to those
gas tanks. If they blow up, it&#8217;ll smash
half the ward.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ran up the ladder to the deck of
the wheelhouse. &#8220;We can&#8217;t get water
to hold her, back there,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;They&#8217;re sucking air from those plugs
already.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley looked from the fire to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
black wall of the factory, from the factory
to the shadow where the street was
hidden, and from the street to the huge
gas tanks that seemed to be leaping and
falling in the wavering light of the
flames. &#8220;We got the water <i>here</i> all
right,&#8221; he said. He asked, &#8220;How wide
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Moran answered
impatiently. &#8220;It&#8217;s about seventy
feet from the wall to the nearest
tank. I can give you two water
towers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley looked back over his
shoulder. The boat was lying between
the lumber wharf at her stern and the
gas company&#8217;s coal pier at her bows.
&#8220;Fire&#8217;s bound to back onto that yard
wharf,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be between
Hell an&#8217; Purgat&#8217;ry here.&#8221; He looked
up at the factory wall above him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
&#8220;That&#8217;ll be comin&#8217; down on top of us.&#8221;
He nodded at the gas tank. &#8220;All right.
We can keep her off them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moran ran down the ladder and hurried
aft. Keighley followed him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the old captain said, in the
voice of a challenge, &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it if the
crew will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moran asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter
with the crew?&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley answered, &#8220;I guess <i>you</i>
know as well as I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moran stepped ashore. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
around the factory,&#8221; he said curtly, and
vanished in the darkness.</p>

<p>Keighley stood stroking his sharp
nose and smiling under his hand. Then
he coughed a dry chuckle, turned, and
ran along the trail of hose towards the
fire.</p>

<p>He considered that he had &#8220;put it up&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
to Moran. It was Moran&#8217;s turn, now,
to learn the danger of promoting dissension
in the place of discipline. Here
was a fire big enough to break <i>him</i>,
if it were badly handled; and he was
relying on a disaffected crew and a
discredited captain to handle it for
him.</p>

<p>Keighley smiled as he ran; and he
ran until the bitter smell of wet embers,
from the burned wood underfoot, was
wiped out of his nostrils by a puff of
smoke that came warm and dry on his
face. It sobered him. He slackened
his pace to fill his lungs against the stifle,
and proceeded carefully. A few yards
farther on, the expected blast scorched
him. When it had passed, he yelled,
&#8220;Hi, there! Moore, there!&#8221; He got no
reply. He broke into a run, stumbled
over the hose, and fell among the burned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
beams and steaming ashes; and as he
sprang to his feet again, the smoke was
cut by a quivering current of heat, and
he saw his crew crouched in a line behind
their pipes, fighting in a wide semi-circle
of flames that held back before
them but reached out, roaring, on both
flanks. &#8220;Back out! Back!&#8221; he called.
&#8220;Yuh&#8217;re no good here. Get back to the
boat! We can&#8217;t stop her here. Come
along with that two-inch line! Lighten
up here, some o&#8217; you men. Chase back
an&#8217; shut off, Moore.&#8221;</p>

<p>They obeyed him in a suffocated silence,
dragging back the smaller hose.
But it was impossible to move the larger
lines as long as they were filled with the
weight of water; and the pipemen who
were directing these, blinded by the resinous
smoke of yellow pine, remained
bent double before the heat that came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
licking across them like the touch of
flame.</p>

<p>Keighley ran to them. &#8220;Get back
an&#8217; uncouple &#8217;em. We&#8217;ll never get out
o&#8217; here this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>A man at the farthest pipe pitched
forward on his face and lay huddled.
His fellows left their nozzle in its pipe-stick,
caught him under arms and knees,
and stumbled back with him. Their undirected
stream threshed about like a
snake pinned down at the neck; and the
fire began to creep stealthily across the
drying debris around it.</p>

<p>A smoking pile of half-burned lumber
close at hand flared up in a sudden flame.
Keighley threw himself on the other
men, dragged them from their pipe, and
drove them back. &#8220;We can&#8217;t fool
here,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;We got to get around
to them gas tanks.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>They abandoned, reluctantly, the two
nozzles that were caught by the lugs in
the crotches of the pipe-sticks, and retreated
with the smaller line. But, even
so, they had to wait until the water had
been shut off before they dared break
the couplings to save the hose; and every
minute was an hour long to the
impatient Moran waiting for them
to stretch in their lines to protect
the threatened gas tanks. He was
fresh to his responsibility, and Keighley&#8217;s
cool insinuation of treachery
had put him to the edge of a new
fear.</p>

<p>When the men got back to the <i>Hudson</i>
with the first lengths of hose, he stormed
down on them angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;re you doing? Get a move
on, will you? What the hell are you
fooling round with that hose for, Keighley?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Stretch in over there, where I
told you! Why the devil&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley, who had his own sense of
dignity, set his thin lips in a tight line
and looked back at the factory.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s yer truck comp&#8217;ny?&#8221; he
growled. &#8220;D&#8217; yuh expect eight men to
stretch in enough o&#8217; this boat&#8217;s hose to
feed two water towers?&#8221;</p>

<p>Moran&#8217;s voice rose to a hoarse curse:
&#8220;G&mdash; &mdash; you! don&#8217;t you talk back to me!
Do what you&#8217;re told. Get a hustle on,
or, by&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley obeyed without more words.
&#8220;Come along, boys,&#8221; he ordered.
&#8220;Leave yer lines there.&#8221;</p>

<p>They jumped aboard the boat and cast
off. The <i>Hudson</i> nosed her way across
the head of the slip until she lay with
her bows a few yards from the coal pier,
her side to the foot of the street that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
separated the factory from the gas
tanks, and her stern in the shadow of the
factory wall. From that position, she
would flank the advance of the fire; her
supply lines, laid up the street, would
front it; and her stern pipes, trained
on the lumber wharf behind her would
check the flames there. The great
danger of the place was this: if the factory
burned, the falling of its walls
would crush the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, now!&#8221; Keighley called.
&#8220;Open up that hose box.&#8221;</p>

<p>His men obeyed him eagerly.
&#8220;Shine&#8221; grumbled to Farley, &#8220;Moran
thinks he&#8217;s the real screw. If he gets
yappy, ol&#8217; Clinkers&#8217;ll take an&#8217; bite a
piece off &#8217;m.&#8221;</p>

<p>Farley, having always been of the captain&#8217;s
faction, retorted jealously, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
<i>you</i> worry.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">KEIGHLEY went forward and
climbed to the roof of the wheelhouse.
He stripped the cover from the
searchlight, and ordered the current
switched to it from the engine room;
and the leakage of light from the metal
hood showed his hard face set in muscular
impassiveness, strong-jawed.</p>

<p>He measured with his eyes the distance
from the boat&#8217;s side to the probable
position of the water towers.
&#8220;Two three-an&#8217;-a-half-inch lines,
Moore,&#8221; he called,&mdash;&#8220;eight len&#8217;ths.
Four inch-an&#8217;-three-quarter ones&mdash;same
len&#8217;ths.&#8221; Then he swung the searchlight
around to the wall of the factory,
and passed the circle of light, like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
great hand, up the windows to the roof.</p>

<p>It showed a brick wall five stories high
and apparently a brick and a half thick.
He brought the light back to the window
frames and grunted &#8220;Jerry-built!&#8221; He
pushed up the helmet from his hot forehead
and stood studying.</p>

<p>The fire, doubling back beside its own
trail, where the half burned lumber was
tinder to the flames, had wheeled around
towards the factory with such rapidity
that the glare of it already lighted the
dark interior of the building. Where
that glare went the blaze would soon be
following; for the windows were unshuttered,
the window trim was bare,
and the walls were a frail shell filled
with all the inflammable material of a
furniture factory. To Keighley&#8217;s mind,
it would be impossible to protect such
a structure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>He narrowed his eyes and watched
Acting-Chief Moran leading up a truck
company to aid in laying the lines from
the boat. Farther up the street, the
lights of swinging lanterns marked the
massing of other companies with hose
and engines, in the probable path
of the fire. He heard the whistle
of the steamers, the bells of the
trucks, the immense murmur of the
pumps vibrating like a huge purr in the
resounding night, and the faint rumor
of roaring flames and falling timbers as
low and wide as the reverberation of a
surf. His nostrils dilated; his frown
cleared. He put his hand on the wheel
of the monitor nozzle beside him and
shouted, &#8220;Loosen yer lines there, men.
Hey, you at the wheel, ring Dady to jack
her back! I want her in under that
wall.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>The boat slid back, paying out its
lines, until the captain and the wheelhouse
came under the factory wall again.
&#8220;Hold her!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Start yer
water! Look out fer yerselves there
men!&#8221;</p>

<p>They scattered as he brought the
standpipe around like a machine gun,
laid it to train on the upper story of the
factory, and spun the valve wheel.
There was a shout of orders from the
deck, answered by another shout from
the engine room; and behind a shrill hiss
of air and spray, a solid stream of water,
under the mighty pressure of eight
pumps, shot from the quivering nozzle
and struck like an exploding shell in a
burst of spray between two upper windows.
For an instant that spray hid
the wall there; then it vanished, sucked
into a black gap; and, above the roar of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
water, glass crashed and bricks thudded;
and the stream, swinging slowly from
window to window, tore its way along
above the line of sills. It rose to reach
the edge of the roof, and ripped up the
sheathing boards, and stripped the tin,
and burst apart the rafters. It came
down again to the windows, and bore in
the wall above the floor, and battered
in the bricks below the floor, and cut
into the floor itself and stripped it to
the beams.</p>

<p>By the time Moran had fought his
way to the pier&mdash;through the rush of a
truck company retreating from a fall
of bricks&mdash;half the wall of the upper
story had been carried away, the section
of the roof above it hung down in
a broken wing, and the stream, thrown
up to clear the ruin, shot over the building,
singing fiercely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>&#8220;Get yer men away from there!&#8221;
Keighley shouted.</p>

<p>Moran cleared the bulwarks with a
running jump and sprang up the ladder
to the wheelhouse top. He clutched
Keighley by the breast of his rubber
coat and faced him, white with fury, his
lower teeth bared as if he were going
to bite, his eyes like two balls of yellow
glass in the blaze of the searchlight,
speechless.</p>

<p>Keighley caught his wrist and growled,
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with yuh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Moran flung him off and yelled,
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with <i>you</i>? Why
don&#8217;t you do what you&#8217;re told, you &mdash; &mdash;!
Did <i>I</i> tell you to do that?&#8221; He
threw out his arm at the wrecked factory.</p>

<p>Keighley shook his head. &#8220;No. Yuh
hadn&#8217;t sense enough to.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>The captain was a tall, big-shouldered
build of Irish ruffian, as hard with age
as an old oak. Moran was shorter,
stockier, heavier in the waist. They
drew back from each other with a
menacing stiffening of neck and
shoulders. Then Moran said, &#8220;You&#8217;re
relieved of your command here.
Report to me to-morrow at headquarters.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i143.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>They had climbed the bunker ladders, and found the port</i></p>

<p class="center">See page 52</p>

<p>Keighley turned to his pipe. &#8220;Relieved
be damned! I&#8217;m responsible fer
this boat, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll take her back to her
berth.&#8221; He threw the stream down to
strike the wall again, and shouted, &#8220;If
we lay here feedin&#8217; yer water towers till
the fire drops the side of a house on us,
where d&#8217; yuh s&#8217;pose we&#8217;ll be? We got
water to smash it in now. We won&#8217;t
have it when we&#8217;re pumpin&#8217; yer six
lines full, will we? There&#8217;s time enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
to stretch in after them bricks is down.
Look out, there!&#8221;</p>



<p>A section of the weakened wall, taken
in the middle, broke and dropped on
itself like a curtain. Half the roof collapsed
and bore down the upper floors;
and the stream, striking free on the ruin,
began to pick it down, course by course,
as Keighley laid the pipe to it.</p>

<p>He did not so much as glance at Moran
again. In the excitement of his work,
he appeared to have brushed aside the
quarrel from his thoughts as he would
have brushed aside any man who got
in his way at such a time. It was a
manner that made all blustering insistence
of authority impossible to Moran.
He waited for the opportunity to reassert
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; Keighley shouted, at
last. &#8220;Shut her off.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>The stream weakened, fell, and
ceased. Keighley turned the searchlight
on the street and called, &#8220;All right.
Now put her back where she was!&#8221; He
dropped down the wheelhouse ladder
and ran aft as the boat drew up again
at the foot of the street.</p>

<p>Moran stood a moment, the jaw
muscle working in his cheek. Then he
went ashore in grim silence.</p>

<p>It was a silence that promised him
satisfaction in the morning, when
Keighley should be notified that he was
relieved of his command.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; chuckled as he dragged on
his line. &#8220;Moran got <i>his</i> dose, I
guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Farley replied, &#8220;There&#8217;s trouble in
it fer th&#8217; ol&#8217; man, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; retorted, in his turn, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
<i>you</i> worry!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XI</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">TEN minutes later the whole street
was blotted out in smoke. The
streams roared from the nozzles, and
were lost in it. The pipemen, with
heads down and eyes shut, braced themselves
against the back-pressure and
fought for breath. The officers, staggering
into them, shouldered them forward,
smothering. The whole line
throttled in darkness, without orders,
without head, swayed and struggled and
stood helpless.</p>

<p>Then, like a stroke of lightning, the
flame split the smoke before them. The
air seemed to explode in a blaze of burning
gases; the heat whipped into their
faces with a stinging lash; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
whole row of lumber piles that faced
them lighted up together like a long
line of beacons.</p>

<p>Against such a fire the streams were
useless. They could beat back the flame
they struck; but as soon as they were
moved from the steaming lumber which
they had saved, the heat licked it dry
again, and the flames leaped back to it.
Behind the fringe which the pipes could
cover, the whole yard blazed untouched.
The windows in the rear of the factory
cracked and broke; the smoke began to
pour out through the wrecked roof; the
fire rose from floor to floor as fast as
it could climb; and it climbed unchecked,
despite the three streams from
the nearest water tower that fought it.</p>

<p>Moran licked the tail of his mustache
and watched nervously. The largest of
the gas tanks towered behind him, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
full current of heat which rained a
steady shower of sparks against it; and
when he glanced back at it his head
jerked around with a twitch. He
ordered one of the deck pipes of the
water tower turned on the tank to wet
it down; and his voice was hoarse and
anxious. Then, when the blaze in the
factory reached the varnish room and
flared out with double fury, he rushed
around, concentrating all his streams on
the one whirl of flame. The sides of
the tank steamed dry at once. He
called out for another line to be
stretched in from the <i>Hudson</i>, and his
voice came shaken from a tense throat.
He was losing his head. The boat line
did not come. In desperation he
started down the street, and was met by
Keighley hastening up at the head of a
squad of the boat&#8217;s crew.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>&#8220;For &mdash;&mdash; sake, Keighley, hurry up!&#8221;
he gasped; and his tone was a confession
of weakness that was willing to forgive
anything&mdash;for the moment&mdash;for
the sake of aid.</p>

<p>The line was stretched and coupled
as fast as drill. The water spouted to
the tank and drenched it. Moran took
off his helmet and wiped his forehead,
trembling in spite of his efforts to control
himself.</p>

<p>Keighley came striding back. &#8220;That
coal pier&#8217;s goin&#8217; up if we don&#8217;t keep her
wet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be worse than the
fact&#8217;ry fer the tank there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moran tried to curse. &#8220;The&mdash;the
whole damn place&#8217;s going up,&#8221; he complained
feebly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The blaze on that lumber pier astern
of us&#8217;ll scorch us out if we don&#8217;t keep
it down,&#8221; Keighley continued. &#8220;We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
want a stream on the wall alongside the
boat. Were pretty near pumpin&#8217; our
limit as it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moran shook his head in a dogged
helplessness.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;re yuh goin&#8217; to do?&#8221; Keighley
insisted. &#8220;We got to do somethin&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217;
be quick about it. Look-a-here!&#8221;
He hurried down to the boat, with Moran
at his heels.</p>

<p>The <i>Hudson</i> was lying at the head of
the slip, in the angle of two fires that
swept her deck with a burning blast of
heat and smoke. Lieutenant Moore
had turned one of the aft standpipes on
the blazing factory and was fighting
back the flames in the nearest windows;
but the stream was too weak to be more
than a small defiance. He had started
the deck spray on the stern, and the
men there were working in a shower;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
but it was a tepid shower, and the metal
and cement of the deck were already
steaming under it.</p>

<p>The coal wharf at the bow was exposed
to all the sparks that blew over
its great wooden hoist and bunkers.
And if the fire took that wharf, the
whole defence would be outflanked; the
blaze would blow from pier to pier down
the water front; the gas tanks would be
caught from the rear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, there!&#8221; Keighley shouted.
&#8220;Turn yer forrud pipes on there an&#8217;
keep that pier wet. Two&mdash;four&mdash;eight&mdash;eleven&mdash;Hell!
We got to save som&#8217;ers.
That won&#8217;t do.&#8221; He turned to
Moran. &#8220;What&#8217;re yuh goin&#8217; to do
about it? There&#8217;s too many streams as
it is. They ain&#8217;t strong enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the acting-chief was at the end
of his resources. It was his first big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
fire, and it was too much for him. He
had the bulldog courage that can take
up a position and hold it, fighting, to
the last gasp of ruin; but he had not the
quality of mind to stand on the height
of responsibility unbewildered, and direct
confusion and overrule defeat.
His face was as blank as his mind; and
Keighley saw it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take charge o&#8217; that boat a minute,&#8221;
the captain said.</p>

<p>Moran took a step towards the <i>Hudson</i>;
and when he stopped and turned
again, Keighley was off up the street.</p>

<p>The old man had a plan&mdash;a plan that
was drawn from his experience of early
volunteer days, when streams were too
weak to tear up a fire by the roots, and
fire-fighters were always on the defensive,
checking an enemy that could not
be successfully attacked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>He ordered the pipe of the nearest
water tower to be raised to the perpendicular,
so that the stream from it rose
straight in the air and fell back on itself
like a geyser. Then he trained the two
deck pipes of the same tower to cut into
the stream with two deflecting ones; and
the three streams, meeting in mid-air,
fought together in a spout of spray that
spread in all directions, formed a
&#8220;water curtain&#8221; which no spark could
pass, and was blown by the wind in a
wide shower over the threatened tanks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut off that other line! Chief&#8217;s
orders!&#8221; he shouted to the men who
were still flailing the tank sides with a
solid stream.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will that shower be enough,
cap&#8217;n?&#8221; one of the water tower men
asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Yuh can&#8217;t set fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
to metal, can yuh? Supposin&#8217; the heat
does swell up yer gas a bit, ain&#8217;t those
telescope tanks? Yuh couldn&#8217;t explode
one o&#8217; them if yuh opened it an&#8217; dropped
a match in. It&#8217;d go out. It&#8217;s got
to have air, ain&#8217;t it? She&#8217;s safe as long
&#8217;s she don&#8217;t warp a leak.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ran along through the scorch to
the second tower, and watched it pouring
a waste of water on a fire that was
already held by the hose from the engines.
&#8220;We&#8217;re goin&#8217; to cut this tower
off,&#8221; he called. &#8220;Chief&#8217;s orders! Yuh
can&#8217;t put that blaze out; yuh got to let
it burn out. The other crews can hol&#8217;
it. Get back up the street there, where
there&#8217;s buildin&#8217;s. Stick to it, boys.
We got to have this water to keep her
from gettin&#8217; down the piers behind
yuh.&#8221;</p>

<p>He doubled back to the water front.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
&#8220;Two&mdash;three&mdash;five,&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;That&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The acting-chief ran into him in the
smoke. Keighley clutched him by the
elbow. &#8220;What&#8217;re yuh doin&#8217; here?&#8221; the
captain cried. &#8220;Why ain&#8217;t y&#8217; aboard
that boat?&#8221; And Moran turned and
followed him like a lieutenant.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THEY sprang aboard the <i>Hudson</i>
together. Keighley ran to the
pipe that was feeding the second water
tower and cut it off at the gate. &#8220;Get
this standpipe on the fac&#8217;try,&#8221; he
ordered Moran. &#8220;We got the water
now&mdash;all yuh want. I&#8217;ll look after the
pier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; wiped the tears from his
eyes and stared open-mouthed. Moran
shouldered past him and swung around
the standpipe and turned it on the
blazing windows. Keighley clambered
up the ladder to the wheelhouse top and
began to bellow his orders through his
hands.</p>

<p>There followed the hottest half hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
that the <i>Hudson</i> ever knew. The coal
wharf had taken fire, and the full power
of the two monitor nozzles was needed
to subdue it. Meanwhile the belch of
heat from the burning factory, checked
only by the lesser streams from the
waist of the boat, swept the deck
like the blast from a furnace. The
paint peeled from the smokestack,
blistered on the wheelhouse, bubbled on
the rail. The men crouched behind the
bulwarks, their eyes smarting, their
throats parched, silent except for a
feeble complaint from &#8220;Shine&#8221; that
they would be &#8220;spittin&#8217; black buttons
fer a month.&#8221; Moran clung to his
standpipe. Lieutenant Moore struggled
against the kick of a pipe which he
had turned on the burning pier at the
stern of the boat. Keighley&#8217;s voice
came to them all, thin and far, &#8220;To yer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
left, Moore. Higher up there, chief.
Stick to it, boys!&#8221;</p>

<p>There is, in such men, an ideal of self-subordination
as strong as the instinct
of liberty itself. In the face of danger
it held them together, under Keighley,
like an oath. &#8220;Stick to it!&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221;
gasped. &#8220;Stick to it an&#8217; roast! Roast!
He don&#8217;t care! The damn ol&#8217; clinker!&#8221;
Farley muttered, &#8220;Ol&#8217; hunk o&#8217; slag!&#8221;
They were filled with a heroic contempt
for him, for themselves, and for their
work; and with an ironical and bitter
loyalty they held to their posts. The
lieutenant blinked the spray from his
stinging eyes and turned for another
look at the acting-chief beside the
standpipe and Keighley commanding
on the wheelhouse. Moran, at every
crash of falling floors in the factory,
expected to see the broken wall forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
out, and was glad that, by virtue of
Keighley&#8217;s foresight, the bricks that
might have crushed the boat were already
lying in a harmless pile at the
water&#8217;s edge.</p>

<p>It was the culmination of Keighley&#8217;s
triumph&mdash;the triumph of the man who
forgets himself in his work, who commands
unquestioned because he orders
what must be done of necessity in the
situation, who humbles himself to his
duty and is exalted by it.</p>

<p>He had drowned out the flames in the
coal wharf; he turned one of his nozzles
on the factory, and poured his tons
of water through the broken wall, and
cut off the flames in the windows. The
roof had long since fallen, and now the
walls followed it; and the hot bricks,
just missing the stern of the <i>Hudson</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
hissed in the water like a blacksmith&#8217;s
irons. For a moment it seemed that
the opening of the building only gave
the flames a fiercer draft. They rose
sky-high with the roar of a volcano in
eruption. But they fell as suddenly;
and, instead of smoke, it was steam
that rose in clouds, and, instead of the
busy crackling of new fuel, the men
heard the sizzle of hot coals drowning
in the flood that was pouring in on them.</p>

<p>The final relief came from the shore
companies that closed in on the ruin,
fighting their way through the smolder
of the yard, and beating down the dying
struggles of the flames with a score of
pipes. To Keighley&#8217;s orders, the boat
drew off and turned broadside to the
burning lumber pier and fairly swept
it from its piles. The acting-chief left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
his nozzle and went forward dazedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, chief!&#8221; Keighley called
to him. &#8220;We got her beat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moran sat down weakly on the bulwarks
and wiped his face. &#8220;Gee!&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I&#8217;m done out. Phew!&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat there, unnoticed, until the last
flicker of the blaze had been stamped
out; then, knowing that the shore companies
would be waiting his orders to
return to their houses, he went to
Keighley. &#8220;All right, captain,&#8221; he said
gruffly. &#8220;The men ashore can finish
this. Let me off here, and go back to
your quarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley nodded. &#8220;All right, boys,&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;We&#8217;re through. Pick up
an&#8217; get away out o&#8217; here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt the prompt response of loyalty
in the way that every man hurried
to obey him with a will. He observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
that Lieutenant Moore received his
orders with an almost obsequious meekness.
He heard laughter from the stern
of the boat as it steamed down the
river; and from the looks of the men,
as he went around among them inspecting
his scorched paint, he knew that
they had watched his quarrel with Moran,
and were proud of him for &#8220;winning
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the boat had been tied up, and
the men had trooped upstairs to their
bunk room noisily, he sat down at his
desk before the open window and looked
out at the first rosy peep of morning
over the horizon. His old eyes relaxed
the thoughtful pucker of their wrinkles
and filmed with a pathetic moisture.
He blinked; his mouth twitched. He
looked down quickly at his papers, tore
a leaf from his daily calendar, rolled it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
in a ball, dropped it in the waste-basket&mdash;and
smiled. When he looked up
again, it was to meet, with a changed
face, the beginning of a new day.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">BUT when he had slept on it, he was
not quite so sanguine, for though
he recognized that he had overcome the
active opposition of his crew, of his
lieutenant, and now of the acting-chief,
he understood that such victories could
be but temporary. He was standing
against the interests of these men; and
by whatever emotions of fear and respect
he had held them back, the emotion
would pass and the interest remain.
He conceded to himself that Moore was
negligible, that the men were almost so.
(If he exercised even ordinary care, he
could protect himself from whatever
small malice there might be among
them.) But if Moran and the Commissioner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
spared him, it would be with
the hope of winning from his gratitude
what they had not been able to force
from his fear&mdash;namely, a disposition
to aid the progress of the benevolent
association of the &#8220;Jiggers&#8221; by favoring
their members in his crew. And
he was determined to do no such thing.</p>

<p>He turned to the newspaper account
of the night&#8217;s fire&mdash;with the fireman&#8217;s
usual excuse to himself that he wished
to see how the reporter had &#8220;botched
it&#8221;&mdash;and he read with sarcastic relish
a detailed account of how Moran had
used a &#8220;water-screen&#8221; to save the gas
tanks, and had so headed off a &#8220;conflagration&#8221;
that at one time threatened to
wipe out half the East Side. He did
not remember that by shouting &#8220;Chief&#8217;s
orders!&#8221; he had himself given Moran
the credit of that move. He accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the report as another of those newspaper
inaccuracies which are a tradition
among firemen. He flung the paper
aside and went out to start the men at
work restoring the <i>Hudson&#8217;s</i> blistered
paint.</p>

<p>It is the rule of the department, of
course, that no fireman shall talk &#8220;for
publication;&#8221; and the unfortunate
&#8220;newspaper tout&#8221; who reports a fire
has to depend to an impossible extent
upon his own eye. It is only after he
has made personal friends of men or
officers that he gets any &#8220;inside story&#8221;
of what has happened, and then only on
condition that he is careful to conceal
the name of his informant. And it is
not merely the &#8220;authorities&#8221; who enforce
this rule; the men themselves uphold
it; and the fireman who allows
himself to be interviewed suffers the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
same sort of treatment from his fellows
that a schoolboy gets from his class
when he &#8220;tattles&#8221; to his teacher. The
men carry in their inside pockets, secretly,
newspaper clippings in which
they have been mentioned honorably,
but they only show these&mdash;ostensibly at
least&mdash;to complain that their names
have been misspelled. Such is the modesty
of nature!</p>

<p>Now the &#8220;newspaper tout&#8221; whom
Farley had mentioned on the way back
from the fruit wharf fire, had a shrewd
suspicion of what was going on, under
the surface of affairs, among the crew
of the <i>Hudson</i>. His attempts to
&#8220;pump&#8221; the men, after the burning of
the <i>Sachsen</i>, had failed for the obvious
reason that the secret to be concealed
was a dangerous one. But, after the
fire in the lumber yard, he caught a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
friendly fireman off duty, full of an enthusiastic
admiration for Keighley&#8217;s
work on the gas tanks, and he succeeded
in finding out enough to show him that
he was on the trail of a &#8220;good story&#8221; if
he could only hunt it down.</p>

<p>After some preliminary scouting and
scenting about, he came boldly to Keighley
himself. &#8220;Captain,&#8221; he said&mdash;for
the captain knew him by sight&mdash;&#8220;where
did you learn that trick of making a
water screen with three streams of a
tower?&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain settled down in his swivel
chair and replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m runnin&#8217; a fire-boat.
What&#8217;re yuh talkin&#8217; about water
towers?&#8221;</p>

<p>The reporter nodded. &#8220;I know. I
was at that lumber yard blaze. I saw
you do that trick with the water
screen.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>Keighley said, &#8220;Say, young fellah,
why don&#8217;t yuh read the papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know all about that,&#8221; the
newspaper man replied. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
way the papers had it. But I saw what
happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley rose. &#8220;Yuh did, eh? Then
what the hell&#8217;re yuh botherin&#8217; <i>me</i> about
it fer? I got enough to do t&#8217; atten&#8217; to
my own bus&#8217;ness without pokin&#8217; any
nose into newspaper muddles. <i>You</i>
atten&#8217; to yer toutin&#8217; an&#8217; I&#8217;ll atten&#8217; to my
fires.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, captain,&#8221; the reporter
called after him as he went out. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
get that story yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>(And he got it, too. <i>This</i> is it!)</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIV</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">DURING that same day, Keighley
received various hints, from various
go-betweens, that the men in power
were prepared to forgive and forget if
he would take the first opportunity to
&#8220;make himself solid&#8221; and come into the
fold. He &#8220;jollied them along,&#8221; gave
them evasive answers, or turned stupid
and failed to understand what they
were proposing. (The weather aided
him, by making activity uncomfortable
even for politicians.) He had the sure
hope that the courts would dismiss the
charges against Chief Borden and compel
his reinstatement under the Civil
Service laws. He heard rumors that
the Fire Commissioner had had a falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
out with &#8220;the Boss;&#8221; and he expected
that with the autumn there might
be changes in the department that
would settle the whole quarrel. Meanwhile,
it was his best policy&mdash;and his
natural inclination&mdash;to stand firm. &#8220;I
got nuthin&#8217; against the &#8216;Jiggers,&#8217;&#8221; he
replied to their emissaries. &#8220;I never
did anythin&#8217; to &#8217;em. There&#8217;s no
trouble here at all.&#8221; And if they
pressed upon him the advantages of
&#8220;getting square up above,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll think it over. I&#8217;ll think it
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>He even received with such evasions
&#8220;Tim&#8221; Noonan, the leader of the
&#8220;Sixt&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;Noonan of the suave Irish
diplomacy&mdash;Noonan who had served
with him as a fire laddie in the red-shirt
days of the volunteer fire brigade.
Wherever Noonan went, he closed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
doors behind him; Keighley heard him
in a silence that was irritating; and
Noonan, in the breathless office, soon arrived
at a blood-hot exasperation that
kept boiling up red in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Keighley promised placidly,
for the fourth time, &#8220;I&#8217;ll think it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noonan plucked from between his
teeth the frayed butt of a cigar chewed
to tatters. &#8220;Now look a-here,&#8221; he said
hoarsely, &#8220;I&#8217;m yer friend I&#8217;m tellin&#8217;
yeh, Dan; but I can&#8217;t go back with no
such answer. An&#8217; <i>you</i> know it. Take
it er leave it. There&#8217;s promotion in it
the one way, an&#8217; there&#8217;s trouble th&#8217;
other. Are yeh with us, er are yeh not,
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley looked out the window and
scratched the back of his hand. &#8220;This
crew,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when I took a hold
here, it was the makin&#8217; of a mince-pie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
An&#8217; it&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; been the worst mess o&#8217;
nuthin&#8217; in the whole department if I&#8217;d
run it Jigger er anti-Jigger er anythin&#8217;
else but straight bus&#8217;ness to put out
fires. I got nuthin&#8217; against the actin&#8217;-chief
ner his gang. They ain&#8217;t botherin&#8217;
me any.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noonan had a long, round upper lip
that met a round, protruding under one
in a mouth like a rent in a rubber ball.
He opened it, and then shut it again in
a politic effort to control his temper,
&#8220;Dan,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;I like a joke,
but I&#8217;m no more a damn fool than y&#8217;
are yerself,&mdash;mind that now! Yeh&#8217;ve
been fightin&#8217; half yer comp&#8217;ny fer the
month gone, an&#8217; yeh think yeh&#8217;ve won.
They ain&#8217;t botherin&#8217; y&#8217; any now&mdash;no.
Yeh think they&#8217;ve had enough&mdash;an&#8217;
mebbe they have. Mebbe they have.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
But there&#8217;s them that ain&#8217;t!&#8221; He
stopped himself. He plugged his
mouth with his cigar again, and puffed
it till it crackled. &#8220;Have sense, now,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Have sense, man. Here&#8217;s
yer chance to get the best that&#8217;s goin&#8217;.
Will yeh take it er leave it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley had turned to listen to the
tinkle of a telephone bell in the sitting
room where the apparatus of the fire
alarm was stationed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will yeh take it er leave it?&#8221; Noonan
demanded.</p>

<p>Keighley did not answer. He swung
around in his swivel chair. Some one
rapped at the door, and he called,
&#8220;Come!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Moore looked in to report,
&#8220;A telephone call from headquarters.
Soap works afire at Nohunk. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
want us to keep it off the coal docks.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were the department&#8217;s coal
docks.</p>

<p>Keighley ordered, &#8220;Cast off.&#8221; He
turned to Noonan. &#8220;Better come along
with us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be cooler outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noonan had found it hot work trying
to lead old obstinacy in the office. The
boat looked inviting. There were two
chairs under an awning in the fantail.
&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said, and went sulkily
aboard.</p>

<p>Keighley took him to the wheelhouse,
instead of to the stern. There was, of
course, a pilot at the wheel; and Noonan
waited in impatient expectation that
the captain would give his orders there
and then go aft to finish their conversation.
But as soon as the boat was
under way, the men, clearing the decks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
for action, began to roll up the awning
and carry the chairs below; and Noonan
looked at the captain with the expression
of a man who had been tricked.</p>

<p>With his gray side-whiskers and his
long lip, he was the sort of Irishman
who would have made an amiable
parish priest if circumstances had not
made him a ward leader&mdash;the sort of
man to whom politics is a benevolent
affair of &#8220;gettin&#8217; jobs&#8221; for his friends
and loyally keeping them from his
enemies. The only dishonesty in public
office that he understood was the
dishonesty of treason to the &#8220;organization,&#8221;
and he despised the political
renegade as he would have despised the
turncoat who deserts his church.</p>

<p>Jigger and anti-Jigger were, as has
been said so often, merely factions of
the organization, and he could come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Keighley with a charitable desire to
convince the captain that he was standing
in his own light. Keighley and he
had been young together. They were
old friends, though they had not met
for some time. Yet Keighley received
him without trust, and held him off.</p>

<p>He smoked resentfully; and the head
wind, through the open window of the
wheelhouse, blew the cigar ashes in his
eyes.</p>

<p>Keighley stood at the pilot&#8217;s shoulder,
his hands behind him, pretending
that he was watching innocently the
course they steered. He said, at last,
&#8220;Volunteer firemen up to Nohunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noonan blinked and grunted.</p>

<p>Keighley glanced at him slyly. After
a pause he added, &#8220;It&#8217;ll remind y&#8217; of
ol&#8217; times.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i179.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>He began to screw out the tortuous scrawl of his report</i></p>

<p class="center">See page 68</p>

<p>Noonan understood that Keighley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
was trying to placate him; and he was
willing to be placated. He was not
shrewd enough to see that the captain
was playing on him. He smoked,
somewhat mollified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ol&#8217; Dolger,&#8221; Keighley said, &#8220;the
may&#8217;r&mdash;er whatever he is&mdash;he&#8217;s got all
the boys with him. They elect him to
ev&#8217;rythin&#8217; up there.... D&#8217; yuh
remember the Red Crows?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noonan made an amicable sound of
assent in his throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dolger&#8217;ll remind y&#8217; o&#8217; Nip himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The memory of the past&mdash;the past
that has always such a poetical appeal
for the Celt&mdash;twisted Noonan&#8217;s lips in
a pleased, reluctant smile. &#8220;Nip was a
great boy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A great boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>The boat was then darting and dodging
through the cross traffic of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
lower river. By the time the railroad
terminals were passed and the breeze
began to come, less bituminous, from
open water, Noonan was laughing and
talking, with his hat on the back of his
head and a blur in his eyes. &#8220;D&#8217; yeh
mind,&#8221; he would say,&mdash;&#8220;d&#8217; yeh mind
the time I put th&#8217; ash-bar&#8217;l over the
hydrant, an&#8217; the boys o&#8217; Big Six went
by it? Ho-ho! They near broke ev&#8217;ry
bone in me body!&#8221; Or: &#8220;Will y&#8217;
ever ferget the night we run Silver
Nine into the ditch at the foot o&#8217;
Chatham Hill?&#8221; Or: &#8220;Hurley, was
it? Well, any way, he put his fist into
me mouth, just as I opened it to yell
&#8216;She&#8217;s over!&#8217; an&#8217; I set down in the road
an&#8217; coughed up teeth be the hand&#8217;ful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley nodded and coughed, puckered
his eyes appreciatively, and
cracked his finger joints behind his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
back. He did not laugh; it was as hard
for Keighley to laugh as it is for most
men to sing&mdash;when sober. Besides, he
knew enough of Noonan to understand
that although the politician&#8217;s joviality
was not all assumed&mdash;although even the
fond moisture of his eye was not from
the eye only&mdash;old friendships would not
change present policies, and Noonan
did not intend that they should.</p>

<p>When Keighley caught the warm
odors of fields and orchards from the
Nohunk shore, he reached mechanically
for the pilot&#8217;s glasses. &#8220;Them was
wild days,&#8221; he said, focusing the binoculars.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ust to hang together well
enough <i>then</i>, Dan,&#8221; Noonan insinuated.</p>

<p>Keighley studied a mist of light
smoke that lay along the water&#8217;s edge,
and worked his lips in the twitching of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
a dryly contemptuous smile. Then he
dropped his cap on the chair beside him&mdash;without
lowering the glasses&mdash;and
with one hand began to loosen his necktie.
&#8220;Looks like Dolger&#8217;s got his work
cut out fer &#8217;m,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The boat went throbbing through the
water at a &#8220;fourteen-mile gait.&#8221; There
was silence in the wheelhouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take us in south o&#8217; th&#8217; ol&#8217; pier,&#8221;
Keighley ordered. He caught the heel
of one boot with the toe of the other,
and jerked off the elastic gaiter; the
glasses did not leave his eyes. &#8220;If yuh&#8217;d
like to come in with us, Tim, I can
give y&#8217; a turnout,&#8221; he said to Noonan.
A fireman passed under the window.
&#8220;Bring me me rubbers,&#8221; Keighley ordered
him, without looking down.
&#8220;Yuh&#8217;re allowin&#8217; fer the current, are
yuh?&#8221; he said to the pilot. Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Moore came to the doorway. &#8220;Get the
starboard lines out,&#8221; Keighley directed,
without turning. He kicked off the
other gaiter, after loosening it with the
toe of his stockinged foot. &#8220;It&#8217;ll remind
y&#8217; of ol&#8217; times,&#8221; he said to Noonan.
And his orders and his remarks
were all given in the same absent-minded
voice of a man who has his eyes
fixed and his mind busy on another
matter.</p>

<p>Noonan laughed admiringly. &#8220;That
aint the way Nip ust to give his orders,
Dan,&#8221; he said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XV</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">FROM that distance, the village of
Nohunk was a cluster of yellow
houses that looked as if they had been
rolled down the sides of the Nohunk
valley and piled together on the water&#8217;s
edge. Behind them, a trail of small
cottages marked the path by which
they had come from the hill-top. In
front of them lay the soap works and
the brewery&mdash;as if their greater bulk
had given them greater momentum&mdash;with
their foundations awash at high
tide, on the far side of an open field at
which the houses had all stopped.</p>

<p>It was this field that had saved the
village from the fire; for the local firemen,
massing in the open, had been able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
to force the flames back on the water
front, following them and confronting
them as they extended down the piers
towards the brewery and the coal yards.
And Captain Keighley, putting in at a
disused and broken pier, on the flank of
the extending line of fire, planned to
drive it back before it reached the coal
wharves, and to hold it back until the
shore companies could drown it out.</p>

<p>To a boat that could lift its hundreds
of gallons of water with every drive of
its pumps, the blaze was a bonfire. To
a crew of men who knew that they were
beyond the reach of the departmental
authorities, the whole affair was a
warm-weather lark. Under a stern
spray that kept them cool, they manned
their lines in blue shirts and old trousers,
all of them bareheaded and some
of them in their bare feet. Keighley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
on the wheelhouse deck, and Lieutenant
Moore, in the fantail, wore helmets and
rubber boots; but Noonan was the only
one who put on a waterproof coat, and
he was directing a monitor nozzle, under
Keighley&#8217;s instructions, with all the
deadly earnestness of an old man at
play.</p>

<p>Two standpipes were trained on the
pier for which the fire was reaching,
and a third was turned on the nearest
coal wharf, to wet it down. But the
brewery was beyond the reach of the
stationary nozzles, being across the road
from the foot of the pier at which the
<i>Hudson</i> had tied up. And Captain
Keighley, peering through the smoke,
could see a squad of volunteer firemen
vainly trying to reach the roof of the
brewery with streams that fell short of
the third story. He was ordering a line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
of hose stretched up the pier to aid
them, when a fat man, red-shirted, in
the white helmet of a chief, came puffing
corpulently down the wharf towards
the boat, waving a speaking trumpet.</p>

<p>It was Dolger.</p>

<p>He was whiskered like a Boer, and
his beard swept the embroidered front
of a yellow plastron that reached to the
bulge of his waist. He waved his hand
at them, and yelled breathlessly, &#8220;Vill
idt cost de county?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noonan forgot his duties at the
standpipe and came over to ask, &#8220;What
is it, Dan? What&#8217;s he talkin&#8217; about?&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley shook his head and looked
away from the spectacle of an excited
old man making himself ridiculous.
Dolger ran to the squad in the stern,
and shouted, &#8220;Vat&#8217;ll idt cost de
county?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>&#8220;Shine&#8221; answered impudently over
his shoulder, &#8220;Nuddings, if yuh don&#8217;t
charge us fer the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dot&#8217;s free,&#8221; Dolger panted.
&#8220;Come along mit idt. I&#8217;ll show yah
vat idt is to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men grinned, and went on with
their work of getting their hose out of
its box. &#8220;Shine&#8221; said, &#8220;Dot voss Santa
Claus in der red shirt. Vee gates vos
loss mit &#8217;im.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dolger threw back his shoulders and
blew out his belt like a drum major.
&#8220;De cabt&#8217;n&mdash;vich is he?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>Keighley had turned his back to direct
the stream which Noonan was neglecting,
and the men, glancing up at
the wheelhouse, understood that their
captain intended to leave the resplendent
chief to them to deal with.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>Dolger explained majestically, &#8220;I am
de chief. Diss feuer iss by me.&#8221;</p>

<p>They laughed with the contempt of
the regular for the volunteer, of the
professional for the amateur. They
began to couple up a line of hose, under
the lieutenant&#8217;s orders, dragging the
lengths out on the pier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stob!&#8221; Dolger ordered. &#8220;Stob idt
so!&#8221; he was suddenly calm and haughty.
&#8220;I don&#8217; vand yah.&#8221; They paid no
attention to him. He waved his hands
at them, with the palms out, as if swimming,
in a gesture that was ridiculous.
&#8220;Go avay back! I don&#8217; vand yah.
Nein!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; with the nozzle, as he shoved
past, said, &#8220;Run away, Dutchy! Nix
kommer ous. Go an&#8217; lost yerself!&#8221;
And Dolger put his trumpet to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
mouth and ran up the pier, shouting
indignant German to the men in the
roadway.</p>

<p>Noonan had been watching the incident
from the wheelhouse. &#8220;What is
it, Dan?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;What&#8217;s he goin&#8217;
to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to give us what
Silver Nine gave the Red Crows,&#8221;
Keighley answered, without a smile.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll remind y&#8217; of ol&#8217; times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, quit yer foolin, Dan,&#8221; Noonan
said anxiously. &#8220;What&#8217;s he up
to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s goin&#8217; to bring his gang down
here to take charge o&#8217; the boat,&#8221; Keighley
assured him. &#8220;How&#8217;re yer teeth?&#8221;</p>

<p>Noonan licked his lips. &#8220;No!&#8221; he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noonan began to unbutton his rubber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
coat. He snorted, &#8220;Huh!&#8221; bellicosely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; Keighley said, &#8220;tend to yer
nozzle. Don&#8217;t let it play in one place.
It&#8217;ll knock holes in that wharf, if yuh
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noonan took the directing-wheel
again, and began to swing the nozzle
from side to side mechanically, watching
over his shoulder for Dolger&#8217;s return.
Keighley went down the ladder
to take charge of his crew, and left
Noonan alone on the wheelhouse top.
And when Dolger&#8217;s men appeared running
through the smoke with their
chief&#8217;s white helmet leading them like
an ikon, it was Noonan who saw them
first. He raised a warlike shout of
&#8220;Hi, boys, hi! Hooks an&#8217; axes! hooks
an&#8217; axes!&#8221;</p>

<p>The men looked up curiously at the
charge of the redshirts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>Keighley said, &#8220;Go on with yer
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noonan screamed, &#8220;All aboard!
They&#8217;re comin&#8217;! They&#8217;re comin&#8217;!&#8221;
And then, seeing that the crew would be
taken unprepared, he swung around his
nozzle to repel the attack himself.</p>

<p>He had had no experience of the
strength of such a stream, and before
Keighley could get back to the wheelhouse
to interfere, the water struck the
deck of the old pier almost at the feet
of the volunteers, lifted the loose planks
on the rebound, and overwhelmed the
company like a burst of surf. Dolger&#8217;s
white helmet flew on the crest of it; the
first men, taken in the faces with the
sheet of spray, were thrown back bodily
on the others; and when the stream,
tearing its way through the planking,
struck a stringer that had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
rotted from its supporting piles, that
section of the pier collapsed under the
sprawling weight of the fallen men, and
dropped them, with the chief himself,
into the water.</p>

<p>By that time Keighley had reached
the nozzle and thrown it up. &#8220;Hell,
Tim,&#8221; he growled, &#8220;do yuh want to
drown &#8217;em? Get yer ladders there,
men!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Haul those fullahs
out!&#8221;</p>

<p>The crew caught up their scaling-ladders
and ran to the gap in the pier.</p>

<p>&#8220;They w&#8217;u&#8217;d, w&#8217;u&#8217;d they!&#8221; Noonan
fumed. He shook his fist at the redshirts
that had rallied at a safe distance.</p>

<p>Keighley caught him by the shoulders
and turned him round. &#8220;Take a joke,
Tim!&#8221; he said curtly. &#8220;Take a joke.
These ain&#8217;t the days o&#8217; Silver Nine.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>He went down the ladder, and Noonan&mdash;with
his coat half off and his
helmet pushed back from his forehead&mdash;remained
to swallow and stare after
Keighley, in the posture of a man who
had been egged on to a fight and then
left and laughed at when his blood was
up.</p>

<p>He understood that he had been made
a fool of. He did not know that he had
done worse than that for Dolger.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVI</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE men whom Dolger had led
down to the <i>Hudson</i> had been
drawn from the squad that had been
protecting the brewery; and he had
taken the chance of getting them back
to the building, with a powerful line of
boat&#8217;s hose, in time to recover any
ground that the fire might have gained
in their absence. Noonan&#8217;s method of
receiving them had been a deadly disarrangement
of their plans. It left the
brewery undefended; and it put Keighley&#8217;s
men at rescue work when they
should have been stretching in their
line.</p>

<p>They got a ladder down to Dolger;
but he was too weak to do more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
cling to it; and they had to bring a
heaving-line from the boat, tie it under
his arms, and hoist him to the pier with
the aid of two of his own men, who
buoyed him up in the water and under-propped
him as he was dragged panting
up the slant of broken timbers. He
had hurt his hip. He was too weak to
walk. He collapsed on the pier in a
pool of trickle from his bedraggled uniform,
and the water ran from his forehead
in the fat pouches of his eyes,
and he moaned, &#8220;Ach Gott! Ach
Gott!&#8221; in a beard that dripped with salt
water like a bunch of seaweed.</p>

<p>They left him there until they had
rescued seven of his men who were
clinging to piles or floating on planks
under the pier; and these gathered
about him, one by one, forlornly, wringing
the water from their trousers, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
off their boots to empty them, or
vainly trying to wipe the smart of brine
from their eyes with the cuffs of their
shirts. Keighley looked them over
sternly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you fullahs know no
better&#8217;n to run into a stream like that?
Do yuh want to get yerselves killed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t see it comin&#8217;,&#8221; one of
them protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Comin&#8217;?&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was <i>you</i>
that was comin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>They muttered and looked back at the
hole in the pier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yuh&#8217;ll get killed at some o&#8217; these
fires, some o&#8217; these days, if yuh go runnin&#8217;
into places full o&#8217; smoke this way,
without lookin&#8217; where yuh&#8217;re runnin&#8217;.
The chief ought to know better.
How&#8217;re yuh feelin&#8217;, chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dolger groaned, &#8220;De brewery! Stob
her!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>&#8220;Help him aboard there!&#8221; Keighley
ordered. &#8220;Cast off an&#8217; run her up the
pier further, Moore, an&#8217; get that line
in!&#8221; The volunteers helped their
limping officer aboard. &#8220;Y&#8217; ought to
know better,&#8221; Keighley grumbled.
&#8220;Runnin&#8217; in blind like that! Hurry
up there, boys!&#8221;</p>

<p>The guilty Noonan had hidden in the
wheelhouse. Keighley saw him watching
from the window, and grimly ordered
the men to carry Dolger in there,
too. While that was being done, the
boat was run up past the gap in the pier
and made fast again; and for the next
half hour Keighley was too busy to
think of Noonan or his victim.</p>

<p>The broadside of streams from the
<i>Hudson</i> had checked the progress of
the fire down the water front, and a
single standpipe was sufficient to hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
it now; but the roof of the brewery was
flaming under a rolling plume of black
smoke, and the excitement ashore rose
to the confusion of a panic. Keighley,
on the bulwarks, gathered together a
herd of volunteers, and drove them with
shouts to drag lines from the hose-box
and stretch them up the pier. They
tripped over their own feet, blundered
with their hose-spanners, tried to screw
the wrong nozzles on the lines, turned
on the water before their couplings
were tight, got in the way of the trained
men, and were bruised and wetted,
blinded, cursed and bewildered, like a
crew of clumsy stage supers caught in
the hurry of a &#8220;dark change.&#8221; When
they got their big line laid and the
water turned into it, the force of the
stream kicked them back as if they had
been trying to hold a cannon; and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
only by virtue of the everlasting luck of
the beginner that the plunging nozzle
did not thresh the lives out of some of
them. Keighley swore disgustedly, and
sat down on the side of the boat.</p>

<p>The brewery was doomed in any case.
He watched it burn.</p>

<p>While he was sitting there, the crestfallen
Noonan came up behind him, perspiring
remorsefully, and wiping his
red face in the crook of his elbow.
&#8220;We got th&#8217; ol&#8217; Dutchman into trouble,
Dan,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Keighley snorted his indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boys all work in the brew&#8217;ry.
He says they&#8217;ll blame him fer bein&#8217; out
o&#8217; jobs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley spat. &#8220;It&#8217;s up to him. It
ain&#8217;t up to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His depaty&#8217;s been in there, crowin&#8217;
over &#8217;m. He&#8217;ll be gettin&#8217; elected to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Dolger&#8217;s place.... He didn&#8217;t try
to save the brew&#8217;ry. He says Dolger
let the soap works burn a-purpose....
The whole dang thing&#8217;s been
botched.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure it&#8217;s been botched,&#8221; Keighley
said. &#8220;What&#8217;d yuh expect? They&#8217;re
too busy playin&#8217; politics to put out
fires.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noonan&#8217;s mouth shut. He stroked
his chin thoughtfully with a thumb and
forefinger, looking down his nose.
Then he went back to the wheelhouse
and lit a cigar.</p>

<p>He did not come out again until the
boat turned homeward, with the sun
setting smoke-red over the hills of Nohunk.
The wreck of Dolger&#8217;s career
stretched from the ruins of the soap
works to the blackened shell of the
brewery. He had been helped to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
home by a squad of loyal officers; his
deputy was wearing his white fire-hat;
and, in the road that had marked his
line of battle, the indignant citizens of
Nohunk were planning a revolution in
his fire-department.</p>

<p>Noonan watched them sadly from the
taffrail. Dolger&#8217;s woes lay heavy on
him. Behind him Keighley said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Between the boys o&#8217; the soap-works
fightin&#8217; the boys o&#8217; the brew&#8217;ry, an&#8217;
Chief Dolger scrappin&#8217; with Depaty
Hencks, there ain&#8217;t much left o&#8217; Nohunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noonan did not reply.</p>

<p>Keighley took a turn around the
deck. When he came back to the stern,
he said: &#8220;Them days is past fer us,
Tim. We don&#8217;t wear red shirts nowadays.
We don&#8217;t elect our Chief. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
get a day&#8217;s pay fer a day&#8217;s work. An&#8217;
we got no use fer politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What d&#8217; yeh mean by that now?&#8221;
Noonan cried. &#8220;Talk straight fer once
in yer life, will yeh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; Keighley said, &#8220;that Jigger
ner anti-Jigger makes no diff&#8217;rence
to me. If a man does his work, I&#8217;ll
stan&#8217; by him. An&#8217; if he don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll
pound him till he does. That&#8217;s the rule
aboard this boat, an&#8217; it al&#8217;ys will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh&#8217;re makin&#8217; a mistake,&#8221; Noonan
warned him, &#8220;a big mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley settled his collar. &#8220;Yuh
better leave me to run me men in m&#8217;
own way. Mind your politics, an&#8217;
leave me to me fires. Yuh&#8217;re a good
deal of a joke with a pipe yerself, Tim.
Yuh&#8217;d better leave that to me.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">NOONAN said no more; and when
the <i>Hudson</i> had tied up, he went
ashore with a non-committal, &#8220;Well,
s&#8217;long Dan&#8221; that expressed nothing but
reserve. Keighley saw him go, and returned,
relieved, to the work of having
the <i>Hudson</i> made ready for her next
run.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re keepin&#8217; us busy,&#8221; he said to
Moore.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8221; were. In the space of three
days, the boat had done duty at three
fires; and the fire on the <i>Sachsen</i>, of the
previous week, had been enough in
itself to make the summer one that
would be easily remembered. But now,
as if to give the men a taste of both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
sorts of life in the department, the days
that followed settled down into the dullest
routine of barrack room inactivity.
The jigger rang and rang again, but it
never rang any of the lucky numbers
that would give the <i>Hudson</i> exercise.
&#8220;Nuthin&#8217; but blanks,&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; complained.
&#8220;This&#8217;s worse &#8217;n playin&#8217;
&#8216;policy.&#8217; Gee, I wish we&#8217;d draw a
number with a fire on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The engineer had work to do, fitting
a sort of drain to carry off the water
that condensed in the low-pressure
cylinder. Keighley was kept interested
by the rumors of bad blood between
the Fire Commissioner and &#8220;the Boss&#8221;&mdash;or
the Boss&#8217;s creature, the Little
Mayor. But the men had nothing but
the shining of brasses and the washing
of hose to occupy their few working
moments, and nothing but the exhausted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
interest of newspapers and
dominoes to pass their long idle hours.
They did not lend any but a languid ear
to the reports of the department intrigues,
now that Keighley had fought
the &#8220;Jiggers&#8221; to a standstill. They
had decided to let that matter rest until
their superiors took it up again.</p>

<p>And then, one warm morning, when
&#8220;Shine&#8221; and Sturton were sitting on
the deck of the <i>Hudson</i>, in the shade of
the wheelhouse&mdash;eating apples which
they had picked out of the scum of
chips and driftwood under the boat&#8217;s
quarter&mdash;something happened that
proved, in its final issue, to have a vital
influence in ending the whole &#8220;Jigger&#8221;
trouble, so far as the <i>Hudson</i> and its
crew were concerned, although the
actual incident itself involved only
&#8220;Shine.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>He had been complaining of the life
they had been leading. &#8220;I&#8217;m sick o&#8217;
this. Sick o&#8217; the whole rotten bus&#8217;ness.
Sick o&#8217; doin&#8217; time in this dang pen, like
a convic&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boat was as hot as an ironclad,
with her metal fittings and cement
deck; but if &#8220;Shine&#8221; and Sturton went
into the pierhouse with their fruit, they
would have to divide it with the other
members of the crew; and they had
elected to endure the heat rather than
lose the apples.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turk&#8221; knuckled the end of his
crooked nose, turned over his apple with
deliberation, and crunched off a fresh
bite. &#8220;Whasmatterith it?&#8221; he asked
thickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rotten!&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; growled.
&#8220;<i>Rotten!</i> That&#8217;s what&#8217;s the matter
with it. It&#8217;s too much scrubbin&#8217; brasses&mdash;an&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s better &#8217;n truckin&#8217;,&#8221; Sturton
said&mdash;remembering the laborious days
he had spent hooking packing-cases and
hoisting bales. &#8220;It&#8217;s the easiest money

&#8220;spring line&#8221; on a Coney Island excursion
boat. He remembered the cool
breeze that had blown in a porthole of
the forward cabin when the deckhands
sat playing pedro there, of an afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
He remembered midnights on the
Bowery, when the boat had been tied up
to her pier, and he had been free ashore
with his month&#8217;s wages in his pocket.
&#8220;Yuh weren&#8217;t chained up to a doghouse
like this, all day an&#8217; night,&#8221; he
said.</p>



<p>Sturton grunted, unconvinced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; chewed and swallowed sullenly,
until his little puckered eyes set
in the open stare of a cow revolving its
cud. He smiled. He followed that expression
with a scowl and bit into his
apple; and, the memory of strong drink
being a thirst in his mouth, the mild
cider-juice of the bruised fruit came as
an insipid aggravation to a longing
palate. He flung the apple overboard.
&#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t fer th&#8217; ol&#8217; woman,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I&#8217;d chuck the damn job.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sturton&#8217;s jaw stopped. Whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
he had a nightmare, he dreamed that he
was discharged from the department.
&#8220;What&#8217;d yuh <i>do</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do?&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; cried. &#8220;I&#8217;d do anythin&#8217;.
I&#8217;d go an&#8217; make a pitch on
Coney fer the summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make a what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a front&mdash;set up a show&mdash;fake
&#8217;em, fake &#8217;em! All the suckers ain&#8217;t
been stung yet.... An&#8217; if I didn&#8217;t
have the money fer that, I&#8217;d go boostin&#8217;
fer a start. I had fifteen boosters &#8217;n
under me onct. Youse guys that think
th&#8217; on&#8217;y way to collar the cush is to go
sweat fer it, like niggers&mdash;yuh make me
tired!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Turk&#8221; shook his head darkly.
&#8220;This &#8217;s good enough fer mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, it is,&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; sneered.
&#8220;Yuh don&#8217;t know any better. Yuh&#8217;ve
never <i>drew</i> any better. If yuh&#8217;d been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
with me an&#8217; Goldy Simpson when we
had the front on Tilyou&#8217;s Walk, we&#8217;d
&#8217;a&#8217; showed yuh life&mdash;life!&#8221; He polished
another apple on his shirt sleeve
and sank his teeth in it savagely. Sturton
did not reply. They ate in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; was bare-footed. He had
taken off his shoes to reach the apples,
standing on a stringer that was awash.
He drew his knees up to his chin now,
to keep his feet within the narrow cover
of the shade, and he sat like a monkey
in a cage, looking over the bulwarks enviously
at the free life on the open river.</p>

<p>When the steamboat <i>Leo</i> of the Coney
Island fleet came paddling down stream
towards him, he took her appearance at
that moment as a particular spite of
fate. The captain was at a window of
the pilothouse; the first mate was standing
over a group of deckmen who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
hauling on the rope that raised a fender;
a waiter leaned on the shutter of a forward
gangway, idle. And &#8220;Shine&#8221;
saw his past float by him, in the sunlight,
like a vision.</p>

<p>He watched it biliously. From a port
of the forward cabin a thin curl of
smoke was drifting out, and he imagined
a contented stoker lolling on the warm
deck within, sucking the reed stem of a
corncob pipe. He remembered a boat
that had been set afire by the butt of a
cigarette thrown overboard from an upper
deck and carried by the wind,
through that very port, into the ropes
and rags and paint-pots of that cabin,
he hoped the smoker in there, now,
would start a blaze. He hoped the old
tub would burn before his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; he said. &#8220;He must be
smokin&#8217; a Dutchman&#8217;s pipe.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>When the steamer was abreast of
them, Sturton suddenly jumped up.
&#8220;That&#8217;s afire, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was; and &#8220;Shine&#8221; came to his feet
as if he had been lifted by the yell of
derision with which he greeted the fact
that it <i>was</i> a fire. &#8220;Hi-yi! <i>Ca-a-ap!</i>
Mucka-hi! Ain&#8217;t y&#8217; afire forrud?&#8221; He
waved his arms and pointed. &#8220;Yuh&#8217;re
smokin&#8217; in the peak!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sturton put his hands to his cheeks
and bellowed, &#8220;Smoke up in front!&#8221;</p>

<p>Their voices drew the other firemen
from the pierhouse; and while these
men shouted questions and &#8220;Shine&#8221;
bawled replies, a cry was raised on the
<i>Leo</i> and the passengers started a panic
across her decks. Almost immediately,
her whistle shrilled the repeated signal
of distress; Captain Keighley ordered
&#8220;Cast off, boys;&#8221; and &#8220;Shine&#8221; ran,
bare-footed, to his duty.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT proved to be a small fire in the excursion
boat&#8217;s stores, and the <i>Hudson</i>
doused it with a single line of hose.
But there was much smoke and more
confusion in the bow of the steamboat;
and when the <i>Hudson</i> drew off and left
the crew of the <i>Leo</i> to swab down the
wet decks, &#8220;Shine&#8221; was hidden in the
forepeak of the steamer&mdash;behind a pile
of cut rails that were used to ballast the
nose of the boat&mdash;listening to the noises
overhead like a boy playing truant.</p>

<p>No one knew he was there, except his
friend Doherty, the ex-fireman, whom
he had found on the lower deck of the
<i>Leo</i>. &#8220;&#8217;S all right, Shorty,&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221;
whispered. &#8220;I been knocked out by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
smudge, see? I fell down the hatch
here, an&#8217; was bumped stiff. Make yerself
scarce now, an&#8217; let one o&#8217; those
deckers fin&#8217; me. Ill raise a holler in a
minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doherty retreated unobserved.
When all was quiet again on the <i>Leo</i>,
the men in the forecastle heard an agonized
moaning on the other side of the
forward bulkhead, and came to
&#8220;Shine&#8217;s&#8221; aid with oaths of amazement.
They raised him up the ladder and supported
him, limping weakly, aft to the
bar. He said in a voice that shook pathetically,
&#8220;Have a gargle, boys, on
me.&#8221; And he said it with such an effect
of unselfish thoughtfulness in pain that
it won them all.</p>

<p>When Doherty returned forward, he
found &#8220;Shine&#8221; the centre of a ring of
admiring deckers who were &#8220;gargling&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
around him in all sympathy. One of
them was rubbing his crippled side; another
supported him by the arm. He
was wincing heroically. &#8220;Come in,
Shorty,&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;What&#8217;ll yuh
have?... That&#8217;s all to the good,
now, boys. I&#8217;m all right. Gi&#8217; me a
beer.&#8221; He leaned up against the bar
and smiled engagingly. &#8220;This&#8217;s on me.
Say, I pull out sixty-six plunks a month,
an&#8217; no more chance to spend it &#8217;an a
savin&#8217;s bank. What d&#8217; yuh think o&#8217;
that? Give a man the hottest job in
Little ol&#8217; Ne&#8217; York, an&#8217; want to keep
him on the dry! What&#8217;s yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>They received his delicate witticisms
with appreciative guffaws, and he
beamed with the cordiality of his invitations
to drink. He was flushed with the
pride of the native who has returned to
his old haunts, rich with the loot of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
alien. &#8220;This &#8217;s on me,&#8221; he kept repeating.
&#8220;What&#8217;ll yuh have?&#8221;</p>

<p>Soda fizzed, beer frothed, whiskey
clucked in the neck of the bottle. The
brown hands went over the bar in an
eager scramble, and the fat barkeeper
juggled with glasses, bottles, siphons
and boxes of cigars like a stage magician.
&#8220;Sure.... On the spring
line.... Th&#8217; ol&#8217; <i>Cyrus</i>....
Have a cigar, then.... This &#8217;s on
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doherty, in the background, listened
sourly to the laughter of the deckmen,
until he saw the size of the roll of greenbacks
which &#8220;Shine&#8221; drew from his
trousers&#8217; pocket. Then he took a last
hasty gulp of liquor and stood looking
fixedly at the bottom of his empty glass.
He put it down on the bar and elbowed
his way to &#8220;Shine.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>&#8220;Have another, Shorty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naw. I&#8217;ve had enough.&#8221; He
touched &#8220;Shine&#8217;s&#8221; elbow significantly
and slid his eyes around in a sidewise
stealthiness without moving his head.
&#8220;Nittsy!&#8221; he said, out of the corner of
his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; finished his glass, shook
hands with the circle, and followed his
friend to the gangway. &#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>

<p>Doherty seemed embarrassed. &#8220;Well,
say,&#8221; he explained, under his breath,
&#8220;they&#8217;re a gang o&#8217; strong-arms. I was
a-scared they&#8217;d get yuh loaded an&#8217;
shove yuh fer yer wad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; laughed. &#8220;I guess there&#8217;s
no one in that bunch o&#8217; &#8217;bos could frisk
me any.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doherty wriggled and grinned.
&#8220;What&#8217;re yuh goin&#8217; to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; leaned on the shutter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
of the gangway and spat at the
water. &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to Coney an&#8217; back.&#8221;</p>

<p>The smell of the past was sweet in his
nostrils&mdash;that indescribable smell of an
excursion steamboat&#8217;s lower deck&mdash;the
bilgy smell of chill dampness, soiled
paint and stale humanity. The churning
of the paddle-wheels and the swish
of water under the guard filled his ears
with a remembered music. Hatless,
coatless and in his bare feet, he took the
sunshine on a guileless smile and
watched the shores of Long Island gliding
past in their old familiar way.</p>

<p>If he had not been blinded by the light
and by his own generous emotions, he
might have seen something suspicious
below the manner of his former messmate,
who peered at nothing with
shaded eyes that shifted cunningly and
a smile that came and went. But Doherty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
talked in the voice of friendship,
and &#8220;Shine&#8221; listened, without looking,
basking in his own good nature.</p>

<p>They did not refer to the trouble with
Captain Keighley. &#8220;Shine&#8221; felt himself
guilty of having deserted from that
quarrel, and avoided the mention of it.
Doherty had long since concluded that
the fire-boat crew did not intend to
avenge his injuries; and he was waiting
for an opportunity to make the
&#8220;quitters&#8221; suffer for having failed him.</p>

<p>He explained that after he &#8220;quit
handlin&#8217; freight&#8221; for the Baltic-American
line, he had gone &#8220;cappin&#8217; fer a con
man that was workin&#8217; the hucks&#8221; on
Coney&mdash;which is to say, he had been the
confederate in a shell game. He had
hoped to start a &#8220;graft&#8221; of some sort
on the Island himself, but&mdash;as he put it
plaintively&mdash;&#8220;a dip went through me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
fer all I&#8217;d put down, one night when I
was paddin&#8217; it in a doss-house on the
Bow&#8217;ry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; laughed good-naturedly at
this tale of another man&#8217;s misfortunes,
as tickled with the sound of his Coney
thieves&#8217; slang as an exiled Highlander
who hears his native Scotch.</p>

<p>Doherty licked his lips. &#8220;D&#8217; yuh remember
Goldy Simpson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I?&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; cried. &#8220;Me an&#8217;
Pikey Moffat&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goldy&#8217;s back at Coney.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;G&#8217; wan! No!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. He was up town yesterday
lookin&#8217; fer a ballyhoo man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; laughed immensely.</p>

<p>&#8220;By &mdash;&mdash;, I&#8217;d like to see him. I&#8217;d like
t&#8217; ask him if he remembers the time me
an&#8217; Pikey Moffat&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t yuh?&#8221; Doherty cut in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
&#8220;Yuh c&#8217;u&#8217;d go back by trolley just as
well as not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; looked doubtfully at his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Borry a pair o&#8217; kicks an&#8217; a hat in the
foc&#8217;sle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; Doherty cried. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
blow off up the island together. I&#8217;m
lookin&#8217; fer a job boostin&#8217; er ballyhooin&#8217;
er somethin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the voice of temptation sweetly
tuned to &#8220;Shine&#8217;s&#8221; own inclination.
He could, in fact, get back to the fire-boat
more quickly by rail than by water;
and even if he did not&mdash;if he &#8220;stopped
over&#8221; long enough to call on &#8220;Goldy&#8221;
and the &#8220;gang&#8221;&mdash;the <i>Leo</i> would carry
back word of his accident in the forepeak,
and he could invent more excuses
to explain his further delay.</p>

<p>He said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get the boots.&#8221; And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
when the <i>Leo</i> tied up at her pier on the
Coney Island beach, he was helped
ashore by Doherty and a deck-hand who
had lent him a hat, a coat and a pair of
shoes for two dollars.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Coney Island that they landed
on is gone now. It was a shouting
gypsy fair of side shows, beer gardens,
dance halls, chowder tents, shooting galleries
and unsavory &#8220;joints.&#8221; It was
not a sweet resort, but &#8220;Shine&#8221; walked
through it, like an old graduate through
the corridors of his college, fondly reminiscent.
He laughed at the &#8220;ballyhoo
man&#8221; drawing the crowd to a booth
with his sword-swallowing and his fire-eating.
He listened appreciatively to
the art of a &#8220;spieler&#8221; praising a &#8220;performance
inside;&#8221; and he turned to
smile on a &#8220;booster&#8221; who put a shoulder
behind him and gently impelled him towards
the ticket office. He sniffed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
odor of steaming frankfurters and fried
crabs. He stood grinning before a
merry-go-round that ground out a deafening
cacophany from a German organ.
And Doherty, beside him, had to stand
and listen, grin and comment, with a
hypocritical pretence of delight&mdash;working
his toes secretly in his broken shoes,
meanwhile, to ease the itch of his impatience
to get on.</p>

<p>They got on, at last, to a saloon which
Doherty had been heading for. It was
a pine &#8220;front&#8221; with a sign that pictured
a beer glass as big as a pail, marked
&#8220;My Size! Five Cents!&#8221; They went
past the bar to the deserted little drinking
room beyond it, and sat down at a
table beside a door which &#8220;Shine&#8221; did
not notice&mdash;and Doherty did. The
walls were covered with colored tissue
papers, cut and folded in fans and circles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
and with printed invitations to the
public not to forget the &#8220;receptions&#8221; of
some half-dozen &#8220;associations.&#8221; These
were a &#8220;Welcome Home&#8221; to &#8220;Shine&#8221;;
and he read them almost sentimentally
while Doherty was gone to speak to
the &#8220;barkeep&#8221; who was a &#8220;frien&#8217;&#8221; of
his.</p>

<p>When he came back with two glasses
of beer, &#8220;Shine&#8221; received his glass with
a &#8220;Here&#8217;s lookin&#8217; at yuh&#8221; that was
warm. He drank a deep libation, open-throated,
without tasting. He put the
glass down and smiled. &#8220;Bum booze,&#8221;
he said, clucking over a bitterness that
burned his tongue.</p>

<p>Doherty kept his snub nose in his
&#8220;schooner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; looked up at an &#8220;invitation&#8221;
above him, and drank again to quench
a sudden heat in his mouth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he said thickly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like
this beer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Doherty assured
him. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get y&#8217; another.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before he returned, &#8220;Shine&#8221; had
drained the first glass. He took the
second unsteadily, grinning at Doherty
to cover the fact that he could not think
of what he had intended to say. He
drank thirstily, put down his glass and
blinked. He had become conscious of
a great lapse of time. It seemed to him
that he had been silent for an hour.</p>

<p>He began to talk very busily, but
without any great success in saying anything;
and to lubricate his difficulty in
articulation he drank and drank.
&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; Doherty asked him,
with each successive glass, and &#8220;Shine&#8221;
assured him&mdash;as well as he could&mdash;that
it was &#8220;A&#8217; right a&#8217; right.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>&#8220;How&#8217;s <i>that</i>?&#8221; Doherty asked at last,
exultingly; and his voice came to
&#8220;Shine&#8221; as a thin rustle of hoarse
sound. The wall seemed to be bellying
like a curtain in a draught. &#8220;I&#8217;m fu&#8217;,&#8221;
he said, and laughed tipsily.</p>

<p>The room had begun to swim around
him, and he drank again, to steady it.
It revolved faster and faster. He shut
his eyes and tried to sit tight, but could
not keep his balance. The motion dizzied
him. He rested his head on the
table, feeling very tired and very sleepy;
and he decided that he would remain
there until the world around him returned
to a state of rest.</p>

<p>When he woke again, in a semi-stupor&mdash;it
seemed only a few minutes later&mdash;he
felt someone kicking the soles of his
bare feet. He was lying on the floor of
a room, stripped to his undershirt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
trousers. He could not see Doherty
anywhere. A stranger was saying,
&#8220;Look-a-here, &#8216;Shine.&#8217; That partner
o&#8217; yours, Doherty, was in to see me this
mornin&#8217;. He said yuh wanted a job
ballyhooin&#8217;. He said yuh&#8217;d do me a
barefoot dance fer the price of a pair o&#8217;
boots. Is that right?&#8221;</p>

<p>He grinned a grin of malice that
showed the gold in all his huge teeth;
and &#8220;Shine&#8221; recognized &#8220;Goldy&#8221;
Simpson.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">GOLDY SIMPSON!&mdash;proprietor
of the &#8220;Alhambra of Mystic
marvels and Persian Beauty Show&#8221;
that had a large and gaudy entrance on
one of the Island&#8217;s &#8220;avenues&#8221; and an
inconspicuous exit on a neighboring
walk. Its promises of entertainment
were as lavish as the paint on its front
canvas, and its fulfilment of them as
shabby as the bleached pine of its back
door. Its whole staff, in fact, was employed
in drawing the public past its
ticket office. Once inside the booth, you
found nothing but three scrawny
&#8220;Persian Beauties&#8221; posed on a curtained
stage; the eloquent Simpson rose
to make more promises of what was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
be seen, for another payment, still further
in, where the police could not interfere;
and the &#8220;boosters&#8221; led those
who paid, down a dark passage, to the
exit&mdash;and laughed at them in the street.</p>

<p>It was to this cave of robbers that
&#8220;Shine&#8221; was led&mdash;led by the promise
that if he assisted the &#8220;show&#8221; for the
afternoon, he would be paid off at night
with 25 cents for car fare, a pair of old
shoes, a cap and a coat in which to return
to town. He had to accept the
offer; there was nothing else to be done;
and he was in no condition to think of
anything else even if there had been
anything.</p>

<p>They dressed him to represent a Hindoo
snake-charmer, in a white cotton
undershirt, baggy chintz trousers, Turkish
bath-slippers and a turban made of
several twisted towels. Still half-stupefied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
by Doherty&#8217;s &#8220;knockout drops,&#8221; he
was shoved out on a platform before the
&#8220;Alhambra,&#8221; heard muffled voices
around him, saw upturned faces below
him in a sort of crowded nightmare, and
went out into the sunlight and came
back into the dark, without understanding
the orders he obeyed&mdash;dazed and
sullen, and all the time groping in the
uproar of a drugged brain for a thought
that moved somewhere in the obscurity
every time Doherty&#8217;s face flashed across
his memory.</p>

<p>He could not recall what had happened.
He knew that he had been with
Doherty&mdash;but that was all.</p>

<p>When the costumed staff of the &#8220;Alhambra&#8221;
sat down, inside the booth, to
a supper that had been brought in from
a neighboring New England kitchen&mdash;to
save the necessity of changing clothes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
and going out to an eating house&mdash;&#8220;Shine&#8221;
found himself with Simpson,
Simpson&#8217;s wife, who was the cashier of
the ticket office, a boy called &#8220;Butts,&#8221;
who turned the crank of the mechanical
piano, and three flaxen-wigged &#8220;Queens
of the Harem&#8221; wrapped in faded dressing
robes. Frankfurters, sandwiches
and beer had been laid out like a picnic
on a trestle-table of rough boards. In
the dim light that filtered through a
dirty skylight overhead, the powdered
shoulders of the women were wanly
white and their unpowdered hands were
<i>not</i>. &#8220;Shine&#8221; sat humped over his
food, unable to eat.</p>

<p>Several times he looked up with a
momentary blink of intelligence, and
then frowned about him in a helpless return
of his stupor, his head aching as if
it would split. He put his hand to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
forehead and cleared his throat. He
asked, in a husky and uncertain voice:
&#8220;Where&#8217;s ... Doherty?&#8221;</p>

<p>Simpson was enjoying the situation.
&#8220;I guess he&#8217;s blowed. I ain&#8217;t seen him
since mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d he tell yuh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said yuh was over at Timmin&#8217;s
lookin&#8217; fer a job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; looked up under his eyebrows
with a bloodshot glower. &#8220;He
sloughed me fer ev&#8217;rythin&#8217; I had on
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right,&#8221; Simpson said.
&#8220;He looked like he had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; put his elbows on the table
and rested his head in his hands. Simpson
winked at his wife. The Queens of
the Harem smiled appreciatively, but
with care&mdash;on account of their &#8220;makeup.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>After a long silence, &#8220;Shine&#8221; said
weakly, &#8220;I got to get back to the boat,
I&#8217;m off without leave. Gi&#8217; me a pair
o&#8217; boots an&#8217; le&#8217; me go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; Simpson promised.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a fullah promised he&#8217;d be here
t&#8217;night. I&#8217;ll let yuh go as soon &#8217;s he
comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got to go now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Long way to walk&mdash;in bare hoofs,
too. Better work out yer contrac&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; tried to focus a wavering
eye on him. &#8220;Yuh&#8217;re in this with Doherty,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Yuh damn double-crosser.
Yuh dirty back-capper!&#8221;</p>

<p>Simpson replied, with meaning, &#8220;D&#8217;
yuh mind the time yuh handed me over
to Pikey Moffat? Think about it.&#8221;
He got up from the table. &#8220;Think
about it,&#8221; he said as he went out.</p>

<p>His wife brushed the crumbs from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
lap of her flowered satin evening gown,
and followed him. The beauties in the
bath robes trailed off to their dressing-room.
The boy began to gather up the
beer mugs.</p>

<p>He looked commiseratingly at
&#8220;Shine.&#8221; &#8220;Wish yuh had <i>my</i> job,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I dreamt I was a music box
las&#8217; night, an&#8217; they wound me up by the
arm. I got a cramp in &#8217;t this mornin&#8217;,
an&#8217; he says he&#8217;ll dock me ten cents fer
slowin&#8217; down to rub it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; did not speak.</p>

<p>The boy looked after the Queens of
the Harem. &#8220;Wish I was a woman,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;an&#8217; didn&#8217;t have to do nuthin&#8217;
but look picturesquew.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sighed. He pinched off the
lighted end of his cigarette, put the butt
in his pocket, and went out, grumbling,
with the beer mugs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>&#8220;Shine&#8221; remained hunched over the
table, staring at nothing and slowly
gathering venom. When he went out
to the platform, he was full of it, bitter
with it, almost indeed sober and clear-headed
with it.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2">&#8220;LADIES an&#8217; gen&#8217;leman,&#8221; Simpson
announced, &#8220;I&#8217;m from
Texas. I&#8217;m from Texas where they valyoo
friendship more <i>than</i> money. An&#8217;
what I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to tell yuh is between
<i>man an&#8217; man</i>.&#8221; He straightened up
with dignity. &#8220;I&#8217;m the <i>pro</i>-prietor o&#8217;
this show. I&#8217;m monarch of all I survey.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved his hand from the display
of his wife&#8217;s shoulders in the ticket office
to the oil canvases of the Indian
nautch girls, the skeleton man, the
&#8220;Wizard of the West,&#8221; the &#8220;Demon
Diavolo&#8221; eating fire, and the &#8220;Modern
Samson&#8221; lifting ton weights&mdash;to the
three Queens of the Harem, sitting on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
the platform with &#8220;Shine,&#8221; under the
flare of a gasoline &#8220;torch&#8221;&mdash;to the curtained
door that led into the &#8220;Alhambra
of Mystic Marvels and Persian Beauty
Show.&#8221;</p>

<p>He screamed with a sudden inconsequent
passion: &#8220;I don&#8217;t hire men to
come out here an&#8217; lie to yuh! No! I&#8217;m
tryin&#8217; to make an hones&#8217; livin&#8217; fer myself
an&#8217; the fines&#8217; comp&#8217;ny o&#8217; <i>per</i>formers
that ever appeared together
under one management on Coney Island!&#8221;
He wiped his forehead. He
lowered his voice. &#8220;An&#8217; to tell youse
the truth, boys, it&#8217;s the toughest proposition
I ever went up against.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a Saturday night, and the Island
walks were crowded. &#8220;Shine&#8221;
was looking down on a throng of white
faces and eyes that shone in the light.
They laughed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>&#8220;I know!&#8221; Simpson cried. &#8220;Yuh&#8217;ve
been faked. Yuh&#8217;ve been payin&#8217; good
money to see a lot o&#8217; ham-fatters an&#8217;
chair-warmers&mdash;a lot o&#8217; stiffs that
couldn&#8217;t get hired fer a supper-show up
in the city. Ain&#8217;t that right?&#8221;</p>

<p>One of his &#8220;boosters&#8221; in the back of
the crowd shouted, &#8220;That&#8217;s what&#8217;s the
matter!&#8221;</p>

<p>Simpson threw up his hands.
&#8220;That&#8217;s it! That&#8217;s it! An&#8217; because I
don&#8217;t come out here an&#8217; promise to give
yuh more &#8217;n I got, yuh don&#8217;t believe me.
An&#8217; I got the bes&#8217; show on the Island,
barrin&#8217; an&#8217; exceptin&#8217; <i>none</i>! A show
that on&#8217;y costs one dime to witness&mdash;an&#8217;
it&#8217;s worth a dollar if it&#8217;s worth a cent!&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a sign to the platform.
&#8220;Shine&#8221; and the three beauties in tights
and tinsel stood up. One of the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
was chewing gum with a pensive movement
of the under jaw.</p>

<p>&#8220;First an&#8217; foremost, let me tell yuh,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;I got Kulder, the Hindoo
snake-charmer, sword-swallower, an&#8217;
fire-eater.&#8221; He pointed to &#8220;Shine.&#8221;
&#8220;Bein&#8217; a native o&#8217; Calcutter, where he
was employed by the Hindoo fire-department,
he was kicked out three years
ago by the Durbar because he wouldn&#8217;t
turn water on a blaze. No! He wanted
t&#8217; eat the flames!&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd grinned. &#8220;Shine&#8221;
scowled.</p>

<p>Simpson went on: &#8220;He&#8217;ll drink
anythin&#8217; from boiled bay rum to knockout
drops. He&#8217;ll walk barefoot from
here to the Batt&#8217;ry to get a look at a
fire-boat. He&#8217;s the simplest an&#8217; sulkiest
an&#8217; treacherest damn fool of a Hindoo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
that ever put up a game on a partner.
An&#8217; he don&#8217;t understan&#8217; a word
yuh say!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; muttered to himself. Simpson
launched out into a glowing description
of the Beauties of his Persian
Harem. He could not bring them all
out on the platform. The police, he
whispered, would not let him. But excepting
the secret palace of the Sultan
of Turkey, there was nothing to equal
it on this side of Madagascar! Nuthin&#8217;!</p>

<p>As for the canvases overhead, they
spoke for themselves. They represented
&#8220;truthfully an&#8217; without <i>ex</i>-aggeration&#8221;
a small part of the mystic
marvels to be seen on the inside for the
small price of a dime, ten cents. &#8220;A
dime! A dime!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;All free
fer a dime!&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy struck up a staggering melody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
on the mechanical piano. &#8220;Shine&#8221;
and the Beauties retreated through the
curtains. The &#8220;boosters&#8221; began to
shove the crowd in towards the ticket
office in a pretence of eagerness to get
good seats for themselves, confiding to
their neighbors that they had heard it
was &#8220;the goods, all right, inside.&#8221;
They paid and passed in; and at least a
score of gulls followed them with more
or less doubtfulness.</p>

<p>That was the first &#8220;push,&#8221; and it was
Simpson&#8217;s habit to make two &#8220;pushes&#8221;
before he gave his performance.</p>

<p>While he was inside, waiting for a
new audience to gather out in front,
&#8220;Shine&#8221; accosted him again. &#8220;Are
yuh goin&#8217; to gi&#8217; me them boots?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; he promised airily.
&#8220;Soon &#8217;s I get good an&#8217; ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; nodded and went back to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
place behind the curtains. Simpson
saw nothing new in the fireman&#8217;s manner.
He had been taunting &#8220;Shine&#8221; all
afternoon with platform insults&mdash;which
&#8220;Shine&#8221; had endured in silence because
he had not understood them&mdash;and
Simpson had mistaken stupor for meekness.</p>

<p>The net was spread for the second
&#8220;push&#8221; in the same manner as for the
first, though in briefer language, for
there was now an impatient roomful inside,
listening.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; here,&#8221; Simpson cried, &#8220;we have
the famous Hindoo snake-charmer. A
pure Brahma&mdash;look at his feet. This
man, ladies an&#8217; gen&#8217;lemen, lives on dope!
He wears no socks. Why? Why does
he wear no socks? <i>Be</i>-cause he
swapped them this mornin&#8217; fer a quart
o&#8217; knockout drops! While &#8217;n under th&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
influence o&#8217; that noxious drug, he&#8217;ll
swally anythin&#8217;&mdash;live fire, nails, carpet
tacks, jollies er anythin&#8217; else yuh throw
into him. He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are yuh goin&#8217; to gi&#8217; me them
boots?&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; growled.</p>

<p>The crowd heard him and drew in
closer, scenting trouble. Simpson
heard him and veered off. &#8220;An&#8217; next
we have three ladies from th&#8217; Imperial
Harem o&#8217; Madagascar&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are yuh goin&#8217; to gi&#8217; me them
boots?&#8221;</p>

<p>Simpson raised his voice to drown the
laughter. &#8220;Three o&#8217; the faires&#8217; flowers
in Eastern womanhood! On th&#8217; inside
we have no less &#8217;n twenty-seven&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a liar!&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; shouted to
the crowd. &#8220;He&#8217;s a liar. He&#8217;s got
nuthin&#8217; at all inside. He&#8217;s a liar an&#8217; a
fakir. He promised me a pair o&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
boots! He&#8217;s a liar an&#8217; a fakir! He&#8217;s&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Simpson leaped on him. The three
frightened Beauties jumped screaming
into the arms of the crowd. In another
minute the whole front of the
&#8220;Alhambra&#8221; was shaking with the uproar
of a riot.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i251.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>The blaze, caught at close range, seemed to snuff out</i></p>

<p class="center">See page 90</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; was a Bowery fighter. He
turned in Simpson&#8217;s clutch and threw
him, and while the &#8220;boosters&#8221; were
forcing their way to the platform to aid
their employer, he pounded Simpson in
a fury. It was impossible to separate
him from his struggling victim, so they
dragged him from the platform, and
Simpson with him; and then some of
the roughs in the crowd raised a cry of
&#8220;Fair fight there! Fair fight!&#8221; and attacked
the boosters. In the midst of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
a gang of Coney thieves made a raid on
the ticket office, and Mrs. Simpson&#8217;s
wild yells rose above the tumult in a
shrill appeal for help.</p>



<p>There followed a free fight and a
general scramble for the gate receipts.</p>

<p>It lasted until the policeman on that
beat called out the reserves to clear the
street; and when these turned their attention
to the cause of the disorder, a
solitary gasoline torch, above the ballyhoo
platform, shone on the deserted
wreck of the &#8220;Alhambra&#8221; front. The
boosters had made their escape by the
back way. &#8220;Butts&#8221; had deserted his
piano, and was sitting in the New England
Kitchen greedily inhaling the
smoke of a cigarette. The Beauties of
the Harem were whispering together in
their dressing-room; and one of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
had an air of inward apprehension
natural to a young woman who had
swallowed her chewing gum.</p>

<p>Mrs. Simpson was in the back room,
bathing her husband&#8217;s face. &#8220;Shine,&#8221;
alone in the Hall of Mystic Marvels,
dressed in his own trousers and a coat
and cap that belonged to &#8220;Butts,&#8221; received
the police with a battered grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;S all right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A gang o&#8217;
strong arms tried to rush the ticket office.
I guess they got away with ev&#8217;rythin&#8217;
but this.&#8221; He showed a torn five-dollar
bill. &#8220;The boss&#8217;s in the back.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed the way to them. When
they came out again, with another version
of the trouble, he had disappeared.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2">LATE that night he returned to the
pierhouse of the <i>Hudson</i> limping,
with his arm in a sling, his face bruised
and an eye blackened. &#8220;Turk&#8221; Sturton,
whose watch it was, received him
without sympathy. &#8220;Cap&#8217;n wants to
see yuh,&#8221; he said sternly. &#8220;Where&#8217;ve
yuh been?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8217;s&#8221; face expressed all the bitterness
of a soul that had found no relief
in its curses. &#8220;Wait!&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Jus&#8217; <i>you</i> wait!&#8221;</p>

<p>He went into Keighley&#8217;s office. The
captain put aside a newspaper that he
had been reading, and looked him over.
&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; moistened his lips and began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
his explanations. They were guiltily
ingenious. He had fallen down a hatch
in the <i>Leo</i> and had lain unconscious until
the steamer was half way to Coney.
Then some deckmen in the forecastle
had heard him groaning and had come
to his rescue. He had been badly
shaken up but not seriously hurt, and
he had decided to hurry back to the
<i>Hudson</i> by trolley instead of waiting for
the <i>Leo</i> to make her return trip. He
borrowed some clothes and went ashore,
but as he was hastening up one of the
board walks towards the street-car line,
he was stopped by a number of men who
were disputing about a cane which one
of them had &#8220;ringed with one o&#8217; them
rings that yuh toss at canes in a &#8216;Cane-yuh-ring-is-the-cane-yuh-get&#8217;
graft.&#8221;
And they had demanded that he decide
whether the cane had been &#8220;ringed&#8221; or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
not. The ring was resting on the knob
of the cane, being too small to fall down
over it. It was a &#8220;faked-up&#8221; dispute.
They were a &#8220;gang o&#8217; strong arms,&#8221; and
when they got him in among them, they
started to &#8220;go through&#8221; him. He put
up a fight. They &#8220;got all over&#8221; him,
knocked him down, gave him a black
eye, and took his money. He had had
to walk back from Coney. He&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do,&#8221; Keighley cut in.
&#8220;Take that sling off yer arm. Yuh
can&#8217;t come any spiels like that on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;S&#8217;welp me, cap, I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut it out, now, I tell yuh. Yuh&#8217;ve
been drunk. Yuh&#8217;ve been off duty ten
hours without leave. Yuh&#8217;ve either got
to gi&#8217; me a straight story er walk the
carpet at Headquarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; swallowed and looked down
at his feet. He was calculating that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Acting-Chief Moran would be lenient
with a &#8220;Jigger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yuh&#8217;ve been havin&#8217; things pretty
much yer own way around here,&#8221;
Keighley said. &#8220;This&#8217;s where yuh take
a drop. The Commissioner&#8217;s out, see?
He quit this afternoon. Youse fullahs
&#8217;er goin&#8217; to do what <i>I</i> say after this.
If yuh go up to Headquarters, yuh
don&#8217;t come back. Moran won&#8217;t save
yuh. He&#8217;s got all he can do to save his
own neck, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; looked at the captain, and
recognized that his game was up.
&#8220;&#8217;Twasn&#8217;t my fault,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was
Doherty&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doherty! What&#8217;d Doherty have to
do with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The damn dip! He done me up,&#8221;
he said&mdash;and plunged into an incoherent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
and many-cursed account of what
had happened.</p>

<p>Keighley heard him in silence. When
Doherty&#8217;s part in the affair was made
plain, the captain &#8220;sized up&#8221; the situation
with the frown of a chess-player
studying the board, and said &#8220;Ummm&#8221;
as he saw his play. &#8220;Shine&#8221; finished,
humble and submissive. Keighley said,
&#8220;Go to yer bunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is the tradition of the department
that a captain shall enforce discipline
in his company without sending his men
to Headquarters on every trifling charge
that he has against them. Keighley
watched &#8220;Shine&#8221; out, snorted contemptously
through his nose, reached
for the newspaper again, and returned
to the column that reported the Fire
Commissioner&#8217;s resignation. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
&#8220;Shine&#8221; where he &#8220;wanted&#8221; him, as he
would have said. And he had his whole
company in the hollow of his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; knew it. The &#8220;Jiggers&#8221;
knew it. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be off to the goose-pastures
fer ours all right,&#8221; Cripps said,
discussing the situation with &#8220;Shine.&#8221;
&#8220;The chief&#8217;ll get back, now, an&#8217; if he
don&#8217;t find a way to break us, he&#8217;ll ship
us off to the Bronx. I don&#8217;t care a
damn anyway,&#8221; he added in feeble defiance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ner me!&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; clenched his
hand. &#8220;I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; fer Doherty. If
they kick me out o&#8217; the department, I&#8217;ll
find him all the quicker. An&#8217; I want
youse fullahs to keep yer eyes skinned
fer him. Jus&#8217; tell me where he&#8217;s workin&#8217;.
That&#8217;s all! I&#8217;ll do the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cripps swore plaintively. &#8220;After us
fightin&#8217; ol&#8217; Clinkers fer him, too.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>&#8220;An&#8217; fer the rest o&#8217; them,&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221;
cried. &#8220;They&#8217;ve played us fer suckers&mdash;Moran
an&#8217; the whole dirty gang.
They&#8217;ve used us. An now when they&#8217;re
afraid o&#8217; fallin&#8217; down, they&#8217;ll chuck us.
That&#8217;s all we&#8217;ll get out o&#8217; the &#8216;Jigger&#8217;
bus&#8217;ness. Yuh&#8217;ll see.&#8221; He wiped his
mouth with the back of his hand; he
was almost &#8220;drooling&#8221; with disgust and
bitterness. &#8220;Never mind. If I ever
get ahold o&#8217; Doherty!&#8221; he promised
himself.</p>

<p>There is nothing persists among these
men as an enmity does. A man who has
been wronged sees the scar of the injury
as a mark of inferiority on him, and his
pride in himself is never satisfied until
he has been able to &#8220;get even,&#8221; until he
has proved himself the equal of his
enemy by returning the hurt in kind.
&#8220;Shine&#8221; could not even consider his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
case in solitude without suffering.
When he was among companions, he
could not think of Doherty without
breaking out in new threats of vengeance,
as if he would give a sort of promissory
note against his debt of hatred.
He asked everywhere for news of
Doherty. His first day off he spent in
searching Coney, with his hands
clenched ready in his pockets. When
he heard that Doherty had been seen
about the docks, he spent hours at the
pierhouse windows watching the river
traffic, and took his weekly holiday
lounging about the water-front with the
instinctive patience of a beast of prey.
By the time a month had passed, the desire
of revenge had become a sort of subconscious
habit that affected his actions
without disturbing his thought. He
went about his work as of old, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
silently, as self-contained as a man with
a great ambition. He knew that if he
could wait long enough he could get his
man. He was prepared to wait a lifetime.</p>

<p>Then, one day, two things happened:
Chief Borden came back to his place in
the department and &#8220;Shine&#8221; heard that
Doherty had been seen working as a
freight-handler again on the Baltic-American
wharves. At meal hour
&#8220;Shine&#8221; did not go to his dinner; he
hurried home to change his uniform,
and posted off to the Baltic-American
sheds&mdash;and he was denied an entrance
by the wharf watchman. Since the fire
on the <i>Sachsen</i> the rule had been strictly
enforced that no stranger should be
admitted to the company&#8217;s piers without
a card from the office. &#8220;Shine&#8221; did not
care to show the metal fire-badge on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
suspender; it was not a case for an
official appearance. He returned to the
<i>Hudson</i> hungry but full of hope. He
could wait for his day off, waylay
Doherty as the longshoremen left their
work in the evening, and mark him for
all time.</p>

<p>As it turned out, he did not have to
wait for his day off. He waited only
two days. On the third day the impossible
happened.</p>

<p>An alarm of fire was rung in from the
Baltic-American piers.</p>

<p>It found Chief Borden closeted with
Captain Keighley when the call came.
Under the eye of the head of the department,
the crew took their places with an
easy alertness and no confusion. The
chief followed them aboard; the lines
were cast off; Keighley nodded an order
to the pilot; and the boat drew out into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
the stream with as little show of haste
as a fast express pulling out from a railway
platform on the tick of the appointed
second.</p>

<p>The sullen glow of a sunset was
smoldering dully over the Jersey shore;
and New York was piled up to face it,
a Gibraltar of brick and stone, twinkling
with its lighted windows and gay
with the blown plumes of steam from its
roofs. A stiff breeze from the north
drove the waves against the bow of the
<i>Hudson</i> and hummed in the guys of her
funnel. Keighley and the Chief, facing
the bow with their backs to the
wheelhouse, their chins sunken in their
collars, were bent against the rush of
air like a pair of old and deaf cronies,
their hands behind them, their heads
together as they talked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was about a man named Doherty,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Keighley was explaining reluctantly.
&#8220;<i>You</i> remember him, I guess.
Some o&#8217; the men didn&#8217;t like it when I
got him broke. An&#8217; they made a little
trouble fer me&mdash;off an&#8217; on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a &#8216;Jigger,&#8217; wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about that fire on the <i>Sachsen</i>?
Didn&#8217;t Doherty figure in that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I saw him there. He was
doin&#8217; &#8217;longshore-work on her. He
might&#8217;ve been in it. I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t they stack the deal on you
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think they did. I don&#8217;t know.
They got foolin&#8217; with a pierhouse blaze
while I was down in her hold....
I tell yuh how it is, chief: it&#8217;s all over.
They&#8217;re attendin&#8217; to bus&#8217;ness. Yuh
needn&#8217;t be a-scared of any of &#8217;em in this
comp&#8217;ny.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>Keighley&#8217;s tone was apologetic and
conciliatory. It seemed traitorously so
to the chief. &#8220;A-scared be damned!&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I got to make <i>them</i> a-scared
of <i>me.</i> Who was at the head of the
game here? Moore?&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley answered, &#8220;The man that
was at the head of it&mdash;he&#8217;s lef&#8217; the
comp&#8217;ny.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief darted a black look at
Keighley under the peak of his cap.
&#8220;No one&#8217;s left this boat since that fire.
I looked her up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Keighley admitted, unabashed.
&#8220;But he&#8217;s left off makin trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now listen to me, Dan,&#8221; Borden
broke out. &#8220;I&#8217;ve come back to the department
and I&#8217;m counting up my
friends. Those that ain&#8217;t with me are
against me. That&#8217;s the way I look at
it.... You know as well as I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
that if I don&#8217;t pound these men, they&#8217;ll
think I&#8217;m afraid of them&mdash;and they&#8217;ll
get to work and knife me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;that&#8217;s true, too,&#8221; Keighley
reflected. He glanced up at the Jersey
shore and down at the deck again. &#8220;I
wish yuh&#8217;d leave them be, though, chief.
I got the best crew in the department,
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief shook his head. &#8220;They
didn&#8217;t leave <i>me</i> be. I can&#8217;t let up on
<i>them.</i> You know what they&#8217;d think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Keighley said, looking out
over the river, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell yuh. The man
that was at the head of it&mdash;&#8221; He
blinked the water from his eyes and
peered into the wind&mdash;&#8220;in this crew&mdash;&#8221;
He raised his arm slowly and pointed.
&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the traffic of ferries, car-floats
and lighters that crowded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
shore, he could see a big freighter drifting
down the piers with a flotilla of tugs
about her. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? Is
she afire?&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief watched her. &#8220;Looks like
it, don&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no answer. He turned to
see that Keighley had left him; and he
followed back to the wheelhouse, where
he found the captain standing at the
pilot&#8217;s elbow with the glasses at his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a Baltic-American boat, all
right&mdash;the <i>Hessen</i>,&#8221; Keighley said.
&#8220;No fire ashore. They pulled her out
of her dock, I guess. I don&#8217;t see much
smoke on her. Lay us alongside, Tom.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the chief, mentally putting aside
his feud with the &#8220;Jiggers&#8221; for the
time, said: &#8220;They&#8217;re keeping it under
hatches. Gi&#8217; me the glasses....
It&#8217;s in one of her after holds.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE <i>Hessen</i> had been loading with
a miscellaneous cargo that included
everything from cotton to baby
carriages and wild animals. She had
seven cargo holds, each four decks deep;
and when a smell of smoke was discovered
in the depths of her fifth hold,
the wild animals were already stored on
the &#8217;tween decks of that hold, with the
baggage and the bunks for the keepers
on the decks below. To save the animals
from being smothered in the
smoke, the hatch of the second deck had
been covered with double tarpaulins;
live steam had been turned in on the
smolder; an alarm of fire had been sent
out for the fire-boat; and the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
had whistled for tugs to tow him out
from the pier&mdash;for the fire that had
spread from the <i>Sachsen</i> to the wharves
had taught the officers of the line to isolate
their burning boats.</p>

<p>When Keighley and his men came up
their ladders to the main deck, the first
officer of the <i>Hessen</i> received them with
a hurried explanation of the situation,
the frightened animals roaring a chorus
in accompaniment from below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you hoist out the cages and
let us open up?&#8221; the chief asked, when
he arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;No place to hoist them to,&#8221; Keighley
said, &#8220;unless we put back to the
pier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if we only cut a hole in the
hatch and pump her hold full of water,
you&#8217;ll lose all the cargo in the bottom,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>The first officer stroked his brown,
German beard. &#8220;T&#8217;e beasts ...
are ... more costly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s three barb&#8217;ry lions, he
says,&#8221; Keighley explained rapidly, &#8220;an&#8217;
two trucks o&#8217; nine trained leopards, an&#8217;
some big gorillas an&#8217; half a circus goin&#8217;
back to Hagen&mdash;what&#8217;s-his-name, in
Hamburg. We&#8217;ll have to flood her
down without openin&#8217; up. Smoke
chokes them brutes off like kittens.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stood beside the open hatch, in
the fading light, and looked down into
the dark cargo room. They could see
faintly the ends of the box cages in
which the animals were penned; and
they could hear, <i>not</i> faintly, the uproar
of a panic-stricken menagerie frenzied
by the smell of fire. They could not
see the deck below, though the hatch
that led to it was open. Keighley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
sniffed. &#8220;It&#8217;s sackin&#8217;.&#8221; He turned to
his men. &#8220;Get yer axes. Bring yer
lamps. Couple up the six-inch line.&#8221;</p>

<p>They turned back to the bulwarks,
shoving aside the sailors. There was
the noise of a scuffle, the cry of an angry
oath&mdash;and a man ran across the deck
and dodged behind the steam-winch that
stood beside the hatch. He was pursued
by a helmeted fireman who came
cursing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; Keighley caught the fireman
by the shoulder as he passed.
&#8220;What&#8217;re yuh doin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was &#8220;Shine.&#8221; He cried, &#8220;That&#8217;s
Doherty. That&#8217;s the damn bug that&mdash;Nab
&#8217;m, Turk.&#8221; He struggled to get
free of Keighley&#8217;s grip, swearing like
a street gamin. &#8220;Yuh double-crosser!&#8221;
he yelled at Doherty. &#8220;Yuh dirty back-capper!
Let me at &#8217;m.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>Keighley turned to Lieutenant Moore.
&#8220;Bring that man here,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>But Doherty did not wait to be surrounded.
He leaped to the open hatch,
caught the rung of the iron ladder and
swung down into the hold.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he doing here?&#8221; the chief
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was loadin&#8217;,&#8221; someone answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haul him up out o&#8217; that,&#8221; Keighley
ordered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; broke for the hatchway,
with two of the men at his heels. He
was half way down the ladder when
Doherty&#8217;s voice from below threatened:
&#8220;The first man &#8217;at comes down here,
I&#8217;ll let the cats loose on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; Keighley said grimly.
&#8220;Bring &#8217;m up. We don&#8217;t want any
more <i>Sachsen</i> games played on us here.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went. But they did not go far.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
&#8220;Shine&#8221; had no more than jumped
down among the cages when a shrill
squealing rose in the hatch. A yell
from &#8220;Shine&#8221; topped it with a startling
note of fright; and up the ladder, over
the men on the rungs, there came a
swarm of monkeys, biting and fighting
like rats as the men tried to beat them
off, and clinging to arms and legs,
shrieking and chattering, when the men,
retreating, began to clamber up. They
poured out, gibbering, on the deck and
put the crew to flight. Then they scattered
in all directions, up the derrick to
the top-tackle, and up the house-work to
the higher decks. And when &#8220;Shine&#8221;
came up the ladder, with the last little
marmoset hugging his neck, the main
deck was empty, the men were laughing
shamefacedly on the bulwarks, and
Keighley was bellowing down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
<i>Hudson</i> for two lines of small hose.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll queer
that game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave him alone,&#8221; the chief ordered.
&#8220;Look after that fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we did on the <i>Sachsen</i>,&#8221;
Keighley replied, &#8220;an&#8217; we ended up in
a hole.&#8221; He added, in a swift aside:
&#8220;All right, chief. I want to show yuh
somethin&#8217;. That&#8217;s Doherty&mdash;the man
the &#8216;Jiggers&#8217; tried to knife me fer. I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; to send after &#8217;m the four jiggers
that&#8217;s left in the crew. I want yuh to
see fer yerself about how much o&#8217; the
Jigger bus&#8217;ness there <i>is</i> in my comp&#8217;ny.
I&#8217;ll take the other men down after the
fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief considered a moment, and
let his silence give consent. Keighley
pushed back his helmet from his forehead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
and turned to his men, his lips shut
tight on a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Moore,&#8221; he called to his
lieutenant, &#8220;I&#8217;ll look after the fire down
there. I want <i>you</i> to take charge o&#8217;
that fullah Doherty an&#8217; see he don&#8217;t put
up any games on us when we&#8217;re &#8217;n
under. Here you,&#8221; he called to
&#8220;Shine&#8221;, &#8220;an&#8217; you,&#8221; to Cripps, &#8220;an&#8217;
you,&#8221; to another Jigger, &#8220;go with the
loot&#8217;nt. Better take a line er two, in
case he lets any more monkeys out on
yuh. Get a move on now. Take yer
lamps. Come on, men. Hurry up with
that six-inch line.&#8221;</p>

<p>The firemen carried their hose over to
the hatch. When the lines were coupled
and stretched in, &#8220;Shine&#8221; said to
Moore, &#8220;Le&#8217; me go ahead, will yuh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Moore understood that he was eager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
to wipe out the disgrace of his first retreat.
&#8220;Go on,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; slung the lantern over his
arm, took the pipe across his shoulder,
and started down.</p>

<p>He was in the middle of the ladder
when Doherty called out to him, from
the roaring darkness of the &#8217;tween
deck: &#8220;Go on down below an&#8217; atten&#8217; to
yer fire, now. If any o&#8217; youse tries to
come in on this deck, I&#8217;ll turn the whole
damn circus loose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; did not reply. He swung
in to the deck and held up his lantern.
Two big gorillas were watching from
separate cages on either side of him,
their teeth shining under curled lips,
glaring at the light. He put down his
lantern and pointed the nozzle like a
gun.</p>

<p>Doherty threatened, &#8220;Here goes!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>&#8220;Tell &#8217;em to start the water,&#8221;
&#8220;Shine&#8221; cried to Cripps who was
behind him. He heard Doherty knocking
the pin out of a cage door, and he
backed into the ladder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sick &#8217;em,&#8221; Doherty yelled; and
&#8220;Shine&#8221; knew, by the direction from
which the voice came, that Doherty was
safe on top of a cage.</p>

<p>Then, down the passageway between
the cages&mdash;in the dim halo that lay outside
the ring of light from the lantern&mdash;&#8220;Shine&#8221;
saw a pair of flaming eyeballs
approaching him. He clutched the
empty nozzle. A black leopard crept
up and crouched at the edge of the light,
its tail beating on the deck. Behind it
he saw another. A third sneaked in beside
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Start yer water!&#8221; he called huskily.</p>

<p>Doherty yelled, &#8220;Sick &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>The leopards snarled. The nozzle
shook in &#8220;Shine&#8217;s&#8221; hands. His jaw
had stuck, open-mouthed. He could
not keep his eyes focused, and he
blinked desperately, going &#8220;blind&#8221; with
fear. &#8220;Wa-a&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The hose stiffened; the nozzle kicked
up. With a cry between a shout and a
groan, he turned the shut-off valve and
let loose a full stream that struck the
deck in front of the leopards and scattered
them as if it had been boiling
water. He yelled, &#8220;Wh-rr-ah! Damn
yuh! Cripps! Crippsey!&#8221;&mdash;and slashed
the water into the huddled gorillas
and stamped beside the lamp, bent
double, like an Indian in a fire dance,
whooping.</p>

<p>A terrific uproar broke loose among
the animals. &#8220;Shine&#8221; tugged on the
hose and dragged it in, drenching everything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
cursing gloriously. &#8220;Come out
o&#8217; that!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Yuh sneak
thief!&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly the electric lights were
switched on from the engine room, and
the place blazed up with incandescent
lamps. The other Jiggers of the squad
joined him, carrying a second line. He
staggered ahead with his nozzle and
turned the corner of a cage to see Doherty
flinging open a barred door to let
loose a Barbary lion. As it jumped
down, &#8220;Shine&#8221; caught it behind with
the water; and the powerful stream
turned it over, rolling on the deck. It
scampered off with its tail between its
legs, like a wet pup.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wah!&#8221; he screamed, and took Doherty
through the empty monkey cage
with a split spray that soaked him.</p>

<p>Doherty ducked and ran. &#8220;There he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
goes,&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; shouted. &#8220;Keep &#8217;m off
the ladder.&#8221;</p>

<p>That deck of the fifth hold was a room
about forty feet wide and thirty feet
long; but the hatch in the center of it
was at least twelve feet square, so that
the deck was little more than a gallery,
as deep as a stall, running around the
open hatchway. As &#8220;Shine&#8221; drove Doherty
and the animals ahead, they had
to circle around the hatch to approach
the ladder from the other side; and
there Moore and the fourth man had
already turned the hose on some of the
frightened leopards&mdash;of which Doherty
had released five&mdash;and driven them back
on him. And Doherty, finding himself
between the two attacks, penned in with
the animals that retreated on him, ran
to a corner where there were several
cages of polar bears, threw open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
doors of these, prodded the bears out
with a pole, and hid himself on top of
the farthest cage.</p>

<p>Lions and leopards would run from
water. Polar bears, he knew, would
not.</p>

<p>If &#8220;Shine&#8221; did not know, it was not
long before he learned. He and Cripps
had come as far as their hose would allow
them when the first of the big white
beasts, attracted by the splash of water,
came shouldering along the passageway
with its mouth open, panting. &#8220;Shine&#8221;
raised a vainglorious whoop and put the
hose on it. It rose on its hind legs to
take the water, and it went over on its
back in a deliciously cool bath, pawing
at the stream that struck it rather too
heavily for play. It rolled over, fighting,
and came to all fours with a growl.
The water struck into its eyes and into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
its open jaws; it dodged blindly, biting
less playfully; it began to wrestle and
roll about, fighting in on the stream.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;This is a garden
hose to that brute. Here&#8217;s another!&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught the second as it came, and
toppled it over on the first. It joined
in the game. While he held one back,
the other ran in under the stream, and
together they gained ground on him.
When the third suddenly loped up and
presented its great bulk to the bath, he
began to shout for a bigger line, retreating
as the bears worked in on him. He
was glancing back over his shoulder
anxiously for aid, when he saw a lion
crouching in the passage behind him,
dripping wet, but of a ferocious aspect.
He lost his voice. He swung his pipe,
gasping, at the newcomer and drove it
back. He turned on the bears again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
and caught them as they came in a body.
He stopped two of them, but he missed
the third, and it rose with an angry
growl seemingly right over him and he
dropped his pipe and fled with a yell.</p>

<p>At that moment a strong stream, from
the deck above, came slantingly down
through the hatch and checked the bear
as it pursued him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIV</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">DURING all this time, Chief Borden
had been at the coaming of
the open hatchway, watching the &#8220;Jiggers&#8221;
from the main deck; and, when
the electric lights had been turned on in
the hold, he had been able to enjoy
&#8220;Shine&#8217;s&#8221; combat with the wild animals,
from a gallery seat. At first he
had been merely an indifferent spectator,
much preoccupied with affairs of
state in the department; but when he
saw the lion driven back among the
cages like a doused cat, the shouts of
laughter from the men around him set
him smiling under his grey mustache.
These men, under Keighley, were lowering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
the big line down into the hold to
attack the fire; and they amused themselves
by shouting encouragement to
&#8220;Shine&#8221; as if they were following a bull
fight. The situation was the funnier
because &#8220;Shine&#8221; was unable to hear
them&mdash;on account of the uproar around
him&mdash;and unable to see them because he
was in the light and they in darkness;
and he whooped and danced about with
his nozzle, unconscious that he was playing
the clown for their amusement.
&#8220;Give it to &#8217;em,&#8221; they called. &#8220;Kick
&#8217;em in the slats. Ho-ho! This &#8217;s more
fun &#8217;an a circus!&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief&mdash;naturally a jovial man,
with a bluff military manner&mdash;enjoyed
it as much as anybody. But when the
bear appeared, they all saw danger in
the joke. &#8220;Here,&#8221; the chief cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
&#8220;He&#8217;ll never hold that brute. Get a
bigger line down to him. There comes
another. They&#8217;ll eat him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley and his men ran back to
bring up a three-inch line, and the chief
remained laughing at the duel between
&#8220;Shine&#8221; and the bears. He shouted,
&#8220;Back out, you fool!&#8221;</p>

<p>Moore and the fireman with him, who
were just below where the chief stood,
heard the order and obeyed it. By so
doing they left &#8220;Shine&#8221; unprotected
from an attack in the rear. When the
third bear appeared, the excitement became
frantic; and the whole company,
from the chief down, pulled on the incoming
hose and shouted and laughed
together.</p>

<p>The chief, at the nozzle, was the first
to see the lion creeping around the
hatch. &#8220;Stop him!&#8221; he cried, to nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
in particular. &#8220;Damn it all! Behind
you, man,&#8221; he yelled to &#8220;Shine.&#8221;
&#8220;Look behind you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; could not hear him. The
chief took off his cap and threw it down
at the animal, vainly. He dropped on
his hands and knees beside the hatch,
clutching the nozzle of the three-inch
line, bellowing hoarsely for water, half-choked
with laughter. When &#8220;Shine&#8221;
caught sight of the lion and turned from
the bears to drive it back, the chief saw
the bears closing in, and he hammered
on the iron coaming of the hatch with
the nozzle, in an inarticulate excitement.
And then he got water just as &#8220;Shine&#8221;
dropped his pipe and ran; and he
struggled with his kicking nozzle, the
tears of laughter running down his
cheeks, unable to see the bears whom he
was trying to take in the flank with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
stream so as to hold them until &#8220;Shine&#8221;
could make good his retreat.</p>

<p>Keighley had been working his men
like an old slave-driver, glancing back
at the chief, every now and then, with
a sly, dry smile. Now he caught Borden&#8217;s
pipe and steadied it. &#8220;All right,
chief,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He&#8217;s out. Here he
comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; climbed, panting, up the
ladder. &#8220;Hold those brutes off us
now,&#8221; Keighley ordered. &#8220;We got to
get down to that fire. Here &#8216;Shine&#8217;!
You an&#8217; Cripps take this pipe an&#8217; keep
those cats away from the hatch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; came to the chief&#8217;s pipe,
grinning at the remarks of the men.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re as good as a circus,&#8221; Borden
said, wiping his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;They scared the tripe out o&#8217; me.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i291.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Keighley turned to his pipe. &#8220;I&#8217;m responsible for this boat&#8221;</i></p>

<p class="center">See page 124</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>The chief gave place to him. Keighley
ordered: &#8220;Down yuh go, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cripps and &#8220;Shine,&#8221; at one angle of
the hatch, and Moore and his pipeman,
diagonally opposite, commanded the
deck below with two solid streams that
drove the animals into shelter among
the cages, while Keighley and his squad,
with axes and ladder straps, went down
to fasten their six-inch line and cut an
opening for the pipe in the hatch. The
smoke blew up in a thick belch as
the men stripped off the tarpaulin.
&#8220;That&#8217;ll keep Mr. Bear busy,&#8221; the chief
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Doherty, too,&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; volunteered.</p>

<p>The chief looked at him. &#8220;Who&#8217;s
this Doherty anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; kept his eyes on the pipe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
&#8220;He&#8217;s the mut that got us all in trouble
the time o&#8217; the fire on that other Dutch
boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought the &#8216;Jiggers&#8217; were at the
bottom of that,&#8221; the chief said, with a
pretended innocence.</p>

<p>&#8220;They blamed it on us. They blamed
ev&#8217;rythin&#8217; on us&mdash;because some o&#8217; the
fat heads higher up used th&#8217; association
in their damn con games.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief scowled at this reference to
the conspiracy that had ousted him.
&#8220;You&#8217;re a &#8216;Jigger,&#8217; are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I am,&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; admitted,
with bravado. &#8220;I&#8217;m a &#8216;Jigger&#8217;
all right, but I ain&#8217;t a back-sticker, any
more&#8217;n half the other fullahs I know&mdash;an&#8217;
they didn&#8217;t ask us before they put
up their deal with the Commissioner, if
yuh want to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief&#8217;s dignity would not let him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
discuss such matters with a man in the
ranks. He said, &#8220;Shut off your nozzles
there, now. You&#8217;re putting too much
water on that deck&#8221;&mdash;and walked away
without further remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; said, under his voice, to
Cripps: &#8220;That&#8217;ll hold <i>him</i> fer a
while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cripps replied, with a convincing
oath, &#8220;It&#8217;s true, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>A hole had been cut in the hatch below,
and a denser smoke rose from it.
There was nothing to do now but wait
for the six-inch line to drown out the
smolder; and Cripps and &#8220;Shine&#8221;
waited, standing with their pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch that ladder,&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; whispered.
&#8220;Doherty&#8217;ll be tryin&#8217; to make
his sneak while its thick up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later, he yelled suddenly:
&#8220;Yah!&#8221; And dropping his pipe, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
ran to fling himself on Doherty as the
ex-fireman leaped out of the smoke.
They rolled together on the deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold that man,&#8221; the chief ordered,
as the crew tore the fighting &#8220;Shine&#8221;
from his enemy. They lifted Doherty
to his feet and backed him against the
winch. &#8220;The police&#8217;ll want him for
interfering with firemen in the discharge
of their duties.&#8221; He turned to
the four &#8220;Jiggers.&#8221; &#8220;I want you men
to appear in court against him, understand?...
That&#8217;ll do <i>you</i>,&#8221; he
said to &#8220;Shine.&#8221; &#8220;Go back to your
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; went back to his place, licking
his lips, with a venomous grin.</p>

<p>The rest of the fire was merely an
affair of &#8220;standing fast&#8221; while the six-inch
line flooded the hold; and in half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
an hour &#8220;the job&#8221; was done. The
German first officer and his men took
charge of Doherty and agreed to turn
him over to the police as soon as their
boat tied up to the pier; and to them
was left the work, too, of returning the
wild animals to their cages. The firemen
were free to pick up their lines and
return to the <i>Hudson</i>, chaffing &#8220;Shine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he swaggered.
&#8220;I&#8217;m a li&#8217;n-tamer, all right, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yuh&#8217;re not much on polar bears,&#8221;
they told him.</p>

<p>He retorted delicately, &#8220;Yuh can&#8217;t
train a brute that&#8217;s got no sense. Polar
bears are like youse guys. They&#8217;re
holler in the cocoa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was <i>you</i> that did the hollerin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was callin&#8217; you fullahs on. I
seen yuh was a-scared to come.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>&#8220;The hell yuh say! Conlin in the
lion&#8217;s den. Y&#8217;ought to set up a show
down on Coney.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shine&#8221; winced at that thrust.
&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; he said, with a curse.
&#8220;I done fer Doherty!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cripps drew him aside. &#8220;Are yuh
goin&#8217; t&#8217; appear against Doherty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, <i>am</i> I!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Watch me!
I wish t&#8217;ell it was a murder case, that&#8217;s
all! An&#8217; if you an&#8217; Moore won&#8217;t stan&#8217;
by me, yuh can go&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Cripps put in
hastily. &#8220;We&#8217;ll stan&#8217; by yuh, &#8216;Shine&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yuh <i>better</i>!&#8221; &#8220;Shine&#8221; said.</p>

<p>The other men kept discreetly silent,
and the boat turned back for the run
down the river.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;WELL,&#8221; the chief said to
Keighley, when they were
alone again in the bows, &#8220;I guess your
company&#8217;s all right, Dan. If those
four men go into court against Doherty,
it lets me out. I&#8217;ve got no kick coming.&#8221;
He smiled a satisfied slow smile.
&#8220;Their association isn&#8217;t as strong as it
was, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley passed a worried hand over
his forehead. &#8220;Chief,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve

two months, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve been doin&#8217; a lot o&#8217;

Here&#8217;s this fire department as clean as
anyone&#8217;d want it, an&#8217; here&#8217;s ev&#8217;ry other
department in this town, between you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
an&#8217; me, gettin&#8217; rotten with graft. Why
don&#8217;t politics get a hold on us.&#8221; He
leaned forward poking out his forefinger.
&#8220;&#8217;Cause politics can&#8217;t put out
a fire, an&#8217; a fire, when it starts, has <i>got</i>
to be put out, er the whole damn town
goes up. Yuh can&#8217;t fool with a fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; the chief said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Keighley went on, &#8220;that&#8217;s
where the &#8216;Jiggers&#8217; fell down. An&#8217; if
<i>you&#8217;ve</i> come back to the department to
pound &#8216;Jiggers&#8217; an&#8217; knife the men &#8217;at
knifed you, that&#8217;s where <i>you&#8217;ll</i> fall
down. Don&#8217;t get on yer ear, now. If
this ain&#8217;t true, yuh needn&#8217;t mind it.
An&#8217; if it <i>is</i> true, yuh can&#8217;t change it by
gettin&#8217; sore on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; the chief said. &#8220;Get it
out of your system.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley nodded. &#8220;These &#8216;Jiggers&#8217;
here tried to stick me, instead of attendin&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
to their bus&#8217;ness&mdash;an&#8217; they pretty
near curled up their toes in the
bottom o&#8217; the <i>Sachsen</i>. Moran tried
to stick me at that lumber yard blaze,
an&#8217; if it hadn&#8217;t been fer the way m&#8217; own
men stood by me he&#8217;d&#8217;ve been burned
out of his job. I attended to my work
an&#8217; treated &#8216;Jigger&#8217; an&#8217; anti-&#8216;Jigger&#8217; the
same. An&#8217; with Moran an the Commissioner
an&#8217; the whole bunch tryin&#8217; to
trip me up, here I am still. There&#8217;s
somethin&#8217; in it, I tell yuh. There&#8217;s
somethin&#8217; in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief tugged at his mustache.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the police,&#8221; Keighley went
on. &#8220;They&#8217;re rotten&mdash;&#8217;cause they&#8217;re
playin&#8217; politics. Here&#8217;s the firemen&mdash;the
same breed as the policemen&mdash;an&#8217;
yuh never hear a word against &#8217;em.
Why? &#8217;Cause our work&#8217;s too hot fer
a grafter&mdash;an&#8217; too hot fer a politician&mdash;an&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
too hot fer a &#8216;Jigger,&#8217; unless he&#8217;s a
fireman first an&#8217; a &#8216;Jigger&#8217; after. You
put back the men that Moran shifted,
an&#8217; let it go at that. If yuh do more,
yuh&#8217;ll do worse. An&#8217; yuh&#8217;ll end up in
a hole. That&#8217;s <i>my</i> opinion.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief said, &#8220;Moran&#8217;s going to get
out. There&#8217;ll be a promotion from the
battalion-chiefs. Do you want to quit
here an&#8217; go on up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217; yuh mean do I want a battalion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley shook his head. &#8220;Not on
yer life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked out at the pierhouse, which
they were approaching. &#8220;I like what I
got. I been three months gettin&#8217;
things into shape here. It&#8217;s a good
crew. It&#8217;s a hell of a good boat.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have a softer thing in the
other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley smiled crookedly. &#8220;Too
much desk work. I ain&#8217;t happy unless
I got a fire in front o&#8217; me. When I
want somethin&#8217; softer, I&#8217;ll take my half
pay an&#8217; quit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221; Borden stretched out
his hand. &#8220;I hope that won&#8217;t be for a
good many years yet, Dan. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keighley fumbled over the proffered
hand. He was not used to the amenities.
&#8220;Good-bye. I hope this&#8217;ll end
the &#8216;Jigger&#8217; bus&#8217;ness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief nodded. They shook hands
solemnly. &#8220;I think it will.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And it did. Deputy-Chief Moran remained
in his position; and through him
it was announced to the &#8220;Jiggers&#8221; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
a general amnesty had been declared,
and that no &#8220;Jigger-jumper&#8221; would be
punished for belonging to his &#8220;benevolent
association&#8221; unless he tried to use
his membership to intrigue for promotion,
or allowed himself to be so used.
That policy was in the end so successful
that the &#8220;Jiggers&#8221; lost even their distinctive
name; and the term &#8220;Jigger-jumper&#8221;
is applied now, in department
slang, to all &#8220;blue-shirts&#8221; who run at
the call of that peremptory little bell to
risk their lives and do their duty.</p>

<p>Ask them! Ask any of Keighley&#8217;s
men. Ask &#8220;Shine.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;re all Jigger-jumpers,&#8221;
he will tell you. &#8220;An&#8217; it
keeps us on the jump. <i>On the jump!</i>
You bet.... There it goes again....
That&#8217;s in our&mdash;Seeyullater!&#8221;
Then&mdash;as <i>he</i> hurries from the sitting
room to the pier&mdash;you will see &#8220;Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Clinkers&#8221; issue from the office, with his
coat on his arm, glance at the clock,
flick you one keen look from a cold grey
eye as he goes by, and clear his throat
to call from the doorway, with all the
confidence of unquestioned command,
&#8220;All right, boys. Let her go!&#8221;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
